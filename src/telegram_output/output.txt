Send us a cal invite b@futureprimitive.xyz and jayden@futureprimitive.xyzYeong says Shared!Fabiano says Ah ok! Jay and i already had a time but maybe we can start off on the technical side on the same meeting if it's ok?Benny Giang says Let’s do that merge the two togetherFabiano says Some thoughts here, my ambition is only to cover page 1, while 2 is more of opinions

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUpiMTRe8b_Hu4dMEwdongIze5Gwbr6zKgBNZkukUK0/edit?usp=sharingShane Fan says Thanks! We will take a look when we are free, super exciting stuff!!Benny Giang says if anyone is interested we're having a quick session to discuss some of the feedback Fabiano shared 

We're live now for the next hour~ 

https://meet.google.com/edy-pmks-pva?authuser=1BigViking says In the middle of a talk :((, will there be notes from the feedback session?Benny Giang says absolutely we will have more sessions in the near future! We'll have a time slot booked to walk through it with anyone from the group.BigViking says That’s so great!Fabiano says That was a great call, even more pumped about token bound now!
Left some brief comments noted in red :)Benny Giang says Hey Paul!! Welcome 🙂Paul Gadi says Hey hey Benny! 🙌🥰0xAndros says Adding Sasha from Feta protocol @bennyg think y’all should connectSasha says Thank you for the intro @andros418 great to meet everyoneBenny Giang says Hey Sasha! Absolutely we will likely organize another working group session after ETHDenver will circle upBigViking says This is great, did a closer read through. Interested to press more  on the use case question as I agree a clear implementation will help drive adoption. I noticed a few examples in the initial EIP, has the group drawn a circle around potential candidates?Jayden says Thanks so much @BigViking5827!

Agreed that defining a clear use case is super important. We're working on an NFT collection that will launch in the next month or so called Sapienz that will incorporate this EIP to allow PFP NFTs to own clothing tokens and "equip" them onto the NFTs artwork.

Are there any interesting use cases that come to your mind? Would love to explore some of them to help prove out the concept :)BigViking says Yes! Once I land after EthD I’ll collect some thoughts and share.Basile Omniscia says Gm teamBasile Omniscia says Not sure if it’s the right place to ask but who should I contact for any security proposal?Jayden says @BasileClinet feel free to DM me :)Basile Omniscia says Done 🙂Benny Giang says hi all! anyone going to NFT NYC (April 11-17)? we want to organize a workshop/lunch session with folks thereBenny Giang says hi everyone! we'll be organizing a tokenbound hangout in NYC April 14th. If you are around or if you know anyone in town would love to meet them IRL

https://partiful.com/e/PPdLPTnyk5DfRUcH72VSBigViking says Awesome!Wilkins Chung says Hey guys. wilkins from Manifold here. We actually have an implementation and spec of this exact paradigm (we called it the “backpack”) that we were in progress of launching. Great minds. :)

There are some differing design decisions though, although minor. Was wondering if you would be open to collaboration and discussion about what your stance would be on the differing elements. Would be great to unify the standard if possible.Benny Giang says Absolutely! Let’s organize a meeting this Friday? Would love to collabBenny Giang says Also if you are heading to NYC apr 14th would love to have you at the meetup https://partiful.com/e/PPdLPTnyk5DfRUcH72VSWilkins Chung says The main differing elements were:
1. Upgradeable wallets
2. Standard implementation proxy bytecode (factory) which has an upgradeable implementation
3. Multiple token bound accounts possible in ours as well, but the way that’s done is deterministic. 
4. An interface in the implementation that allows marketplaces to handle the security vulnerability pointed out easily.Wilkins Chung says Won’t be in NYC. But let’s chat. What’s your schedule on Friday look like?Wilkins Chung says What timezone are you in?Wilkins Chung says (For 2, when I say upgradeable, I mean owner upgradeable)Benny Giang says PST want to find a slot that works for you https://calendly.com/benny-fp

We are also based in Vancouver :)Wilkins Chung says What about today? There seem to be some slots avail.Wilkins Chung says Would love to chat as we are actually close to launch as well and would like to not clutter the ecosystem with competing things, lol.Benny Giang says We are actually flying to SF right now. Tomorrow morning works as wellWilkins Chung says Tomorrow meaning Wednesday or Thursday?Benny Giang says 100% let’s find a way for us to team up. I think competing ideas around NFT wallets will quickly get confusing for the end usersBenny Giang says Thursday 9am PSTWilkins Chung says Happy to chat then but don’t see that slot avail.Benny Giang says Whats your email I’ll send an inviteWilkins Chung says wilkins@manifold.xyzBenny Giang says Cool just sentWilkins Chung says Nice. Good to connect on this. And hopefully we can unify on a design and even share smart contract code bases. 

We were close to release it open source along with a number of content partners, but the latter was the hold up.

Our repo was called the “token-owned-wallet” and product was “the backpack”, lol.Wilkins Chung says Looking forward to Thursday! I really believe in this primitive.Benny Giang says 100% looking forward to itBenny Giang says @wwhchung feel free to invite other team members to the call as wellWilkins Chung says Nice! This was our launch product use case as well (hence the backpack name)Benny Giang says Great call @wwhchung let's work within the GH repo https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6551/filesFabiano says Looks cool! Can you guys share the repo with me as well? @flocknous

I'm friends with Benny and as KLKTN/Weebox we've been considering using the standard. I'm interested and curious on the upgradability partBenny Giang says fabiano we're working from here now https://github.com/erc6551/Benny Giang says and wilkins (manifold) have made theirs public https://github.com/manifoldxyz/token-owned-wallet-solidityAuryn 🔆 | Gnosis.io says Hey folks, just wanted to share this thing that we built.

https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan/status/1642284057483710464?t=LLKCWbCmku-UKZrK4yuY_w&s=19Jayden says This is very cool! Love the metaphor of a mech for this patternAuryn 🔆 | Gnosis.io says Just adding others from Gnosis Guild that will be interested in this. ( @jfschwarz and @samepant wrote mech)Benny Giang says Perfecto thanks!! Excited to organize a working group session.

Btw if any gnosis members are in NYC Apr 14, feel free to swing by our meet up https://partiful.com/e/PPdLPTnyk5DfRUcH72VSAuryn 🔆 | Gnosis.io says I think we'll all be in Tokyo by thenAuryn 🔆 | Gnosis.io says But @samepant is normally in NYCemo.eth says gm 🌞 was hacking on something similar a few months ago; never got around to fully testing or adding EIP1271 support though

i did some work trying to wrangle security concerns by only allowing transfer when frozen, and revoking all (known) token approvals when freezing: https://github.com/emo-eth/non-fungible-agents/blob/main/src/Agent.solBigViking says This working group is 🔥so stoked to see the parallel projectsYeong says Agree!!Wilkins Chung says If anyone is curious I’ve submitted a PR which contains an example implementation of how you can use a static proxy implementation for predictable addresses but still allow for changing underlying implementation. https://github.com/erc6551/reference/pull/2Wilkins Chung says You can deploy other proxy instances to “namespace” accountsJayden says For those interested, this is the repo that houses the minimal reference implementation from the EIP: https://github.com/erc6551/referenceBigViking says Thx JaydenBenny Giang says @auryn_macmillan @jfschwarz @samepant how do you feel about finding a time to see if there's a way for us to collab on the ERC standard? looks like there'll be mutual gain for the entire space and gnosis expertise around multi-sig + scws would be great, certainly something that can bolster up the adoption for token bound accounts. 

lmk if you have some time next week?0xplus7🐰 says Hi @bennyg  We're probably building "the first" project based on 6551 which started 3 months ago. It's a desktop pet chrome extension users can upgrade and customize the NFT based on their on-chain activities. A little leak here: https://twitter.com/sofamon_xyz/status/1641941885819420672?s=20 . We're happy to bolster up the adoption for token bound accounts together!!!0xplus7🐰 says In our case, the Sofamon itself is a NFT and also a wallet. Then we visualize users wallet/NFT as a desktop buddy so that users can interact with blockchain like playing a mmorpg gameBenny Giang says This is the perfect use case for 6551! Digital outfits and items are a natural fit and it’s just a beginning since the standard turns all NFTs to almost a folder structure it could open up a myriad of game use cases that require inventory systems.0xplus7🐰 says Exactly, and also all on-chain transactions can be part of the level system for the game character!Benny Giang says 0xplus7🐰 says Any ideas on how the token bound accounts interact with other protocols on the front end design? Considering the current wallet connect dashboard is dominated by MetaMaskJayden says We're working on a few solutions to this, will share very soon :)Jayden says DM me if you want a sneak peekAuryn 🔆 | Gnosis.io says Yeah, let's jump on a call this week.Auryn 🔆 | Gnosis.io says Old article that Kei wrote which is yet again relevant

https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e?gi=60f836aa9d6bBenny Giang says welcome new folks!Yeong says 👋Benny Giang says some early feedback sessions today! @notyeong @flockonus if anyone is available this week would love to book a time to discuss ERC6551zomglings says Hey @bennyg and @polats : meeting or async?Benny Giang says want to book a time https://calendly.com/benny-fpBenny Giang says follow the erc standard on twitter for community/builder wide announcements https://twitter.com/erc6551Josh says Hey all - just joined via Benny. See a few familiar faces here! I was not aware of the proposal until today, but I'm working on a project that has been planning to build out NFT wallets for our use case and subsequently make the tech available for all NFTs. We're happy to find a group of folks that are underway with this already! 

Looking forward to exploring what has been accomplished so far and figuring out how we can collaborate on this ❤️Benny Giang says Benny Giang says excited to have you here @heershingenBigViking says 👋 I’ve zeroed an opportunity to implement 6551 for a web3 auto-chess game that I want to bring to market (85% complete).  I can shape the NFT strategy and have some ideas along the same use case as the Sapienz collection but with in-game impact… I’m interested to have a deeper discussion to learn more about what’s possible and get some feedback. 

The 5v5 auto-chess/auto-battler game is called “What The Funge,” .. pretty fun and silly. Characters are Funges you can buy in pack drops. We have a default set and we’re working with other collections to onboard some of their PFPs to create additional sets of Funges with stats etc., that can battle. 

I’ll drop in a Notion with more this week. I’ll also be at the Tokenbound event and looking forward to meeting everyone.Paul Gadi says @zomglings would love to join the call, just add me in on whatever time workszomglings says 2 pm ET Friday works?zomglings says sentBenny Giang says perfect!Krisma says Hi all, seen tokenbound and insta joined to follow the progressPaul Gadi says gm @krma_0 !Krisma says gmBigViking says Gm 👋 welcomeraihan (FWB) _ says Thanks for the invite @bennyg and excited to see so many familiar faces in here already :)JM says ok im hereJM says Thanks for the invite @constantcoffeeBenny Giang says welcome!!iamnick.eth says Hey all!Benny Giang says Hey everyone! welcome, wondering what are some of the use cases that y'all have been thinking about with something like ERC6551?Benny Giang says We've thought about a few:

- Membership NFT with POAPs, NFT stickers, etc. to build reputation for members
- Gaming inventory systems
- Digital fashion and outfits
- Music stems (STEMSDAO) and music NFTs --> Playlists
- Less interesting but is there... DeFi a basket of yield bearing NFTs inside of a single NFTBenny Giang says also we're going to be doing a big push for ERC6551 soon. we got some really cool launch partners that are already onboard. would love to feature you if you're considering building on 6551 so we can show off all the potential use cases 🙂 

❤️ emoji if interested!BigViking says Tokenized RWA are easily going to approach a trillion dollar market on top of purely digital assets. Citibank (fwiw) recently called it a “the killer use case” that blockchain needs to drive. 

I’ve been thinking more deeply about implications of the 6551 for digital and RWA, and you can apply it seemingly to just about anything that’s ‘complex’ as defined simply by “holds other assets.”  

Examples of complex assets could be: 

- A land title NFT with the accompanying paperwork, housing blueprints, history of work on the property etc., 

- A car NFT that holds its components like the infotainment system, rims, muffler, etc., 

- A sports team (esports team) like the Vancouver Grizzlies (RIP) and its player contracts, merchandising agreements, etc.,  (THIS one I love, I want to build it if anyone else is keen. You can operationalize the entire mechanics of a sports league with smart contracts and tokens, I started some work last year). 

Other interesting patterns: 

- A “family tree” with seemingly unlimited branches and paths. Can contain family documents, old pictures, records etc., 

I’m not sure if the nomenclature of “complex” works here, but I thought it provided an easy way for a new user of the 6551 to understand appropriate use cases broadly. You’ll have to help me to understand if differentiating ‘complex’ from ‘simple’ (meaning shouldn’t hold anything else, like an atomic component of a complex asset) makes sense. In that case a simple asset would be like your classic 721, which although now endowed with the ability to own an account, and other assets, perhaps shouldn’t in some cases?BigViking says 👋 wouldn't mind being a fly on the wall for the next conversation if there's space.Jayden says @BigViking5827 definitely! Next one will be open invite :)BigViking says ❤️Eric Diep | manifold.xyz says gmBenny Giang says hello!!SimpleLT says GmSummer says gmBenny Giang says Don’t forget to emoji!BigViking says Anyone keen on pitching in to organize a 6551 hackathon in Vancouver?Jayden says Absolutely!

We can probably use DCTRL or Home Key as a spaceBigViking says oooo niceBigViking says Whats the timing looking like for the push?Benny Giang says @Tangle0x let’s do it!! Maybe in May?Jess says Could be fun. Keep us in the loop. I need to get out more in Vancouver!Jess says Also hey folks. Jess from Seed Club here. Stoked to be here.dex says Hi JessYeong says I'd love to get our dev team out there! 😄Eric Diep | manifold.xyz says @richerd6046YingMu says Hello, ERC 6551!gjwang king says gm，exciting to know about ERC6551gjwang king says I had seek the similar way to bring more possibilities to NFT, ERC6551 seems a exciting proposal0age says Just took a read-through of the EIP; cool stuff!0age says A few thoughts: one, as-is there’s no way to support deploying wallets to the same account cross-chain. This will lead to people losing funds and not being able to recover them by mistakenly transferring to their wallet on the wrong chain, and more generally it’d be pretty sweet to be able to have a single account on multiple chains that’s ultimately controlled by an NFT on a specific chain0age says Another potential danger is that as-is anyone can deploy a wallet for any NFT without that NFT owner’s permission; it might make sense to require that the caller is the owner of the NFT in question, or to submit a 712 signature from that owner as a prerequisite for deployment0age says One more thought: if 1167 is already being modified to add extra data in the footer, it might make sense to go with a slightly better minimal proxy; I proposed this one a while back https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-more-minimal-proxy-5756ae08ee480age says The chainId should be removed from the footer if multichain wallets are to be supported, and there’s no reason to encode the token address with 32 bytes in the footer and increase deployment costs by 2400 gas for the 12 unnecessary zeroes; I’d even propose a more compact encoding for address & tokenID (definitely the tokenID) where the first byte represents the number of bytes required to contain the value, followed by the value0age says Compact implementation addresses could also be supported by the registry; here’s a recent factory that does something similar https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/utils/ERC1967Factory.solJayden says hi @z0age! great to have you in here and thanks so much for the comments :DJayden says curious to hear more about your cross-chain concerns. Assuming the wallet implementation and registry addresses are static across chains, you should be able to deploy the same wallet at the same address across chains by passing in the same chain id, token contract address, and token id. It's of course up to the wallet implementation to support cross-chain calls, but that's outside the scope of the EIP.0age says Aaaah I was misunderstanding the premise, I was thinking the chainId was specific to the _current_ chain when it’s actually the chain where the NFT is deployedJayden says Yes, there is definitely a tradeoff here. We're currently allowing permissionless deployments because that will allow use cases such as an NFT collection developer deploying the accounts for each token in its collection. Agree there is a spam vector here, but similar to spam NFTs there is no risk if you don't interact with the malicious contractsJayden says Correct :) Adding chainId as an arg to createAccount is supposed to make cross-chain addresses possible. Can definitely make this more clear in the proposal!Jayden says Yes - there is some work on the go right now to improve the proxy implementation as the current version is a bit hacky. You can see some of the (potential) changes here if you're interested: https://github.com/erc6551/reference/pull/1/files#diff-3a404fd7a68b2339df2b362768348f62dbe266177bfbb4d0681fb43e343cd58bJayden says Will definitely take a look at this, thank you!Jayden says Agreed that the encoding is poorly optimized. At the moment it's using standard abi encoding to simplify reads on the implementation contract end and also minimize custom-encoding-related bug potential. Can definitely explore a more optimized encoding and would welcome any contributions you'd like to make in this area :)Jayden says @z0age any recommendations for a battle-tested solidity packed encoding library that we could pull in to encode the footer? Or is this something that would have to be built from the ground up?Wilkins Chung says @z0age there are changes to those changes as well in a PR here 

https://github.com/erc6551/reference/pull/2Wilkins Chung says I want to be mindful of custom encoding and decoding gas cost. Want to make decoding as efficient as possible because it will likely be used in every operation for permission controlWilkins Chung says (Hence using constants for code at offsets)Wilkins Chung says This repo also has an upgradeable example with some other items in that example (nft accounts owning other nft’s), as well as tests for that example which show how you can do operations in a chain of ownership.0age says That’s a good point, but only if the footer is being fed to the implementation as an addendum to calldata in a clones-with-immutable-args style; otherwise it’s only accessible via extcodecopyJayden says Curious why it's preferable to append the footer to the calldata when it can be read directly from byte code within the implementation?0age says Well if the minimal proxy is delegatecalling to the implementation (and the minimal proxy has the footer), then codecopy will refer to the implementationJayden says I don't think so? This is what we're currently doing and it works fine0age says Can you link to the code?Jayden says I think we're using extcodecopy0age says Ah yeah that’s what I figured0age says That does add some unnecessary overhead; incentive is for implementations to assign their own immutables at that point0age says Not that big of a deal either way thoughJayden says True. Ideally the immutable data is controlled by the registry to provide strong guarantees around token binding so that implementations can't lie about which token they're bound to.Jayden says Would love to optimize the storage space, but really hard to beat the simplicity of extcodecopy + abi decode on the client side.Jayden says If you know of any existing libs with similar dx to this but more optimized encoding would definitely be open to modifying at the registry level :)0age says I mean especially in cases where you have the NFT contract on the same chain, you could perform just the auth check directly on the proxy before delegatecalling the implementation0age says That would definitely add some overhead to deployment costs, but not a ton (and would simplify implementations as they’d have assurances that the NFT owner was the caller already)Jayden says Ooo that's a really neat idea0age says Would require certain non-compliant NFTs like cryptopunks to use adapters, but that’s also not a big dealJayden says Totally. Curious how this might distinguish between authenticated and non authenticated calls at the proxy layerJayden says Because a cold call to the 721 contract on every tx for read only operations is a downside0age says If caller is the owner, delegatecall; otherwise, staticcall?Jayden says Proxy still needs to call ownerOf on staticcalls though, which adds a lot of gas for a static call. Not a big deal though since most of those will just be simulated via rpcJayden says But for any on-chain calls it'll burn more gas0age says You could support passing in a “no ownership checked” flag that then gets relayed to the implementation so it knows the call hasn’t been authed?Jayden says I guess, but custom calldata or an additional arg for all functions on a contract seems a little less than ideal for clients interacting with accounts0age says Would break transparency of the proxy in those cases though0age says I’d imagine it would be like an optional magic value at the start of calldataJayden says Yep, or at the end a la meta transactions0age says So you wouldn’t have to supply itJayden says kind of like it as an opt-in gas optimization at the client level. Call will still work without it, just +2.6k gasBenny Giang says welcome @jamessyoung! a good friend and leader of collab land. so many great people in this working group 🙂James (never DM first) says thanks for the invite @bennyg great looking group here I must say!Wilkins Chung says That’s the big debate. How much stuff to put into the proxy.Wilkins Chung says Right now it’s literally just ability to read implementation (which, to me, was important because a malicious implementation could lie) and delegating everything else.H says I’d like to introduce Chris @rwiggum CTO of Lit Protocol! We’ve been following 6551 closely and would love to explore any possible integration points on either end 👌🏼Peter | Horizon says hey all 👋☺️Benny Giang says Welcome @elux101 to the 6551 party 💕 def interested to hear more about horizon and sequence thinks about the standardPeter | Horizon says I think it’s super creative and clever, great work on it :) I just need a bit more head space to think about the best use casesBenny Giang says welcome all! I see @oxfoobar has joined 🙂Benny Giang says foobar says gm gmDaes says Excited to be here! Great timing too because last month I was trying to figure out what would the best way create onchain subaccounts and this seems to be the perfect solutionJayden says @daes_cs amazing! Would love to hear more about your use case and how we can help support you :)Daes says yes indeed! We're looking at attaching game passes and assets to our onchain gaming DID as a gaming vault feature where you can store game passes and assets as NFTs.

Mules was the first thing I thought of when I saw this EIP.Sillytuna says Mule would be so good still. No time tho!Benny Giang says welcome @Sillytuna !Sillytuna says 🤘Benny Giang says Welcome!!Dino says How to understand implementation address？Dino says external address?Dino says I can't understand how the user account controls the band account?Jayden says Hey @Dino_zhao! The implementation address is the address of an ERC-6551 compatible smart contract account. Each token bound account is deployed as an ERC-1967 proxy. The account implementation gives the owner of an NFT execution permissions on the NFT's account.

We have an implementation you will be able to use very soon, shoot me a DM if you want early access to it :)Jayden says There are also a few example accounts in the reference implementation repo: https://github.com/erc6551/reference/blob/main/src/examples/simple/SimpleERC6551Account.solBenny Giang says for those coming to the ERC 6551 NYC meetup this Friday!

Good crewEric Diep | manifold.xyz says gm - adding @blauyourmind from a16zMichael Blau says Thanks Eric! glad to be here 🙂BigViking says 👋👋Jayden says welcome @blauyourmind :)Benny Giang says Welcome!Jessica xian says 🧐Jayden says ERC6551 is live on testnet with mainnet support coming soon. There are several teams building products using 6551 even though it's still fairly earlyJayden says RMRK is building some neat stuff in this space as well, but takes a slightly different approach. ERC6551 is compatible out of the box with RMRK's various NFT composability proposals. This graphic is a great intro to composable NFTs, and is applicable to 6551 as well.让子弹飞一会 says GreatBenny Giang says Welcome everyone! As you know we have the first working group meet up in NYC later today. In this meetup we will be announcing companies or projects that are supporting 6551 and are planning to experiment/use it. We already have around 15 confirmed supporters. If you are interested in being mentioned or displayed in the presentation. Please send me the following. DM me here @bennyg or email b@futureprimitive.xyz 

1. Name of project or company
2. Website
3. SVG or transparent PNG logo (black version is possible) 
4. How you plan to use 6551 within your project

As you all now 6551 is an open standard. As stewards our goal is to work together with the broader community to help build consensus so we can move the proposal towards finalization. Thank you 🙏Krisma says sent you a msg about https://twitter.com/visualmachinaDruzy Quest says @bennyg, adding @sirsuhayb here to connect, he’s building Stadium, a protocol for esports and daos, also blvkhvnd and a number of other amazing projects in the space. Some great use cases for Tokenbound + Stadium with online gameplay & player teams operating on-chainJayden says Awesome, great to have you @sirsuhayb! Would love to jam on potential use cases with you sometime :)Benny Giang says Yoo SirsuSirsu says yo yoSirsu says thanks for the link @druzyquestSirsu says also @bennyg you gotta be out in the city more lol there's TONS to eat after 10 lolreffo | timbre says Hey everyone! This is Reffo from Echo (www.0xecho.com). Thanks to Tokenbound that we will be able to mint great comments/text data as NFT and airdrop to your jpeg’s wallet.    Every NFT deserves a history. We are so excited about the journey!🤙Jayden says Amazing, welcome @reffo! Awesome demo at betaworks the other day btw :)reffo | timbre says Thanks Jayden! Let’s bring more fun use cases to life!Benny Giang says LMAO!!!

I've been bullish on nesting NFTs since the end of 2020. Glad that it's being turned into a proper EIP now. Back then there was Charged Particles protocol which was trying to do the same, but they chose a walled garden scenario which has totally killed them imo.Fedor Linnik says Back then I was running a Kool-Aid themed meme project where users could mint ERC-1155 flavors of Kool-Aid (we didn't care about copyrights much back then XD) and mix (burn) them in various proportions to get rarer ones. 

We wanted to make a 2nd season where each common flavor would be minted out of some native $KOOL token + some other popular ERC-20 and then mix them so rare flavors absorb all the ingredients and become baskets of assets. However, there weren't any good L2 options available back then and doing something like that on ETH would be too terribly gas-inefficient so we eventually scrapped that idea. ERC-6551 makes me want to try it again on Arbitrum maybeFedor Linnik says That's what it was supposed to be likeBenny Giang says ^that's exactly the reason why we worked with this community to create this standard! we tried and looked at everything out there! Been working and building onchain game mechanics since CK, Cheeze Wizards, STAPLEVERSE, etc. but everytime it was like bashing your head against the wall.

1. [on-chain inside of the NFT contract] Charged Particles, RMRK, ERC998, etc. Resulted in walled gardens, doesn't work with existing NFTs, limited to some on-chain assets (like 721)

2. [on-chain external contracts] space doodles, wrapped, etc. Can't modify existing NFTs and had limitations, custom contract development (costly and potential security risk), poor conversion because NFT owners have to take the onchain action 

3. [offchain] this one is straight forward. centralized. expensive to build and maintain. not contributing to the common good. 

All 3 options would have difficulty on adoption and created uneven playing fields that is in favour of projects with a lot of $$$ and can afford custom contracts or offchain infra. Existing platforms like marketplaces, wallets, dapps didn't know how to handle all of these custom contracts and therefore created an adoption challenge.

ERC 6551 as a open source standard is trying to solve that problem by:

- backwards compatable with every single NFT 
- out of the box support for all onchain assets (20, 721, 1155, etc)
- give power back to the NFT owner where they can control/add logic to their NFTs intead of being at the mercy of the project creators
- 10x easier to integrate (see SDK). Plus uses wallet infra that has existed for many years. 
- Infinitely flexible and open to anyone to build on top ofFedor Linnik says I think the best off-chain solution was Emblem Vault, but it's not practical for what ERC 6551 is designed for. They found their niche with Rare Pepe and Ordinals though. 

It's awesome that you have an SDK (that's, again, what Charged Particles failed to do)Fedor Linnik says I have one more possible application in mind. Storing loreFedor Linnik says My other project is 7,777 AI-generated Pepe and we want to migrate them from BNB Chain (we launched in 2021) to ETH and make some absurd AI-generated lore for each of them. So I thought that minting these pieces and binding them to NFTs can be quite handy. 

There was Hyype protocol for NFT lore but it seems dead. Also, some unlaunched Story Protocol, but no info about it yetFedor Linnik says Btw, is it possible to use the tokenbound account to interact with other smart contracts? Like, accepting a bid on a marketplace without withdrawing an NFT from it?Jayden says Love this!Jayden says Yep! You can execute arbitrary smart contract calls, so accepting bids is fully supportedJayden says Can also sign messages from the accountFedor Linnik says Oh, that's awesome! 

As if we take most of solutions that existed before ERC 6551, you had to withdraw the NFT first which could be quite costlyMatej yangWao says Thanks for invite @bennyg 

Hey there, we (@vikiival) are doing KodaDot ( https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery ) and we are quite excited see that this narrative of NFT accounts are moving close to be real and we would like happy  to collaborate! 🙂

I'll catch up with this group and try to follow up on things!Sirsu says @druzyquest yer lemme know when you and the crew have time to chat next weekBenny Giang says totally! ill ping you @sirsuhaybraihan (FWB) _ says man like sirsuMarc M | Animoca says Hello, Marc from Animoca here. Thinking of using 6551 for character loadouts in games. 

2 questions:
- Could we impose restrictions on what NFTs can be transferred to the wallet? (E.g. only 1 of each item type, or only items of a specific metadata attribute)
- How do you imagine the UX for 6551 to look like? For example on OpenSea, we’d probably want them to aggregate the NFTs that belong. I know it’s early days on this but front end adoption would definitely help the game experienceMarc M | Animoca says Circling back to the first question, if it was a Diablo style game we’d want to ensure that the character has only 1x hat, 2x gloves etc and that they are attributes that match the class of the characterMarc M | Animoca says Wondering where this logic would live if it’s even possiblezomglings says Since EIP6551 deploys a smart contract account - the easiest way to impose these kind of restrictions would be to allow for custom onERC721Received callback on the particular account implementation you are using which implements these constraints.zomglings says Interesting, I am considering how to integrate EIP6551 with the NFT Inventory I have built, and auto-equipping items into inventory slots sounds like a good way to do so. Thanks for the idea @maccahb .Wilkins Chung says To expand on this, eip6551 allows anyone to specify their own implementation. Effectively, each implementation can be viewed as its own “namespace”. You can restrict what that wallet can receive (Eg you could reject any transfers aside from an nft transfer) or even prevent creation of working wallets  for non-approved tokens (by implementing an initialize function with a check)Benny Giang says @jakeloo on fire!! hahaBenny Giang says welcome allJake L says Hey, invited our team here because we are working towards something similar at thirdweb. Would love to find ways on how we could collab. 
Specifically, we are thinking a lot about 4337 smart wallet extensions and i think theres probably some overlaps. Will need to dig into the design more. But would also be curious to hear the differences on how you all are thinking about itWilkins Chung says You can use 4337 with 6551.  They're parallel.Wilkins Chung says like NFT's can have account abstracted wallet implementations if that's what you want to do.  In fact, that is something we considered as  a supported use case.Jayden says Great questions! You can definitely restrict NFTs going to a given token bound account. The simplest way to do so is to implement a hard ownership cap per-wallet at the NFT contract level if the owner is a token bound account. This way you don't need to implement a whole smart contract wallet just to enforce ownership rules. You can also override the onERC721Received method on a custom account implementation as @zomglings mentioned. If you're planning to use the open-source account implementation, you could also add this logic as an extensionJayden says Awesome to have you here! As @wwhchung mentioned, 6551 works great in tandem with 4337. The open-source account implementation we've released has built-in support for 4337. Very curious to hear more about some of the things you're building around 4337 extensionsMarc M | Animoca says Anyone from the team going to be at Consensus? Would love to discuss some use cases (I’m a designer so only technical up to a point)Yneas says 👋Benny Giang says thinking of hosting an online working session next weds/thursday.

I pinned a working doc to the group messages. 🚀😃Christina.lens says eyyyyy @bennyg glad to be here! Left you a VN on that line yesterday 🙂Benny Giang says ohhh whaaa ill have to check itFullGrown ? says If I want to retroactively turn NFTs I own into a token bound account, are they wrapped or is the 721 still in the original collection?Krisma says no wrapper, transfers in/out + bounded addressFedor Linnik says Hey! I have a question as I'm not technical enough to discover it myself. Does 6551 enable creation of infinite accounts bound to the same NFT? 

Like, can there be one account which abides certain rules (e.g. timelocks, asset slots and etc.) and another one devoid of such limitations?Benny Giang says @Fullgrownadult once 6551 goes to mainnet every NFT since CryptoPunks will have a TBA without any actions needed from the owner, creator, etc. The best way to find out the account address for your NFT is to use tokenbound.org (testnet atm but it'll match with mainnet later).

Think of tokenbound.org as a visual etherscan to look into an NFT's account and take actions like transfers. If you watch the demo you can see how it sort of works https://share.vidyard.com/watch/cL3EtXfEJsKzRAuMWLsKqVBenny Giang says Yes theortically you can nest NFT's infintely. Check this out as an example https://tokenbound-demo.vercel.app/graph/0x25aFbE3aD35bDad4612d5E918b3767aAa0852a14

Moonbird #5621 owns every single NFT below it. The lines represent ownershipBenny Giang says Yes accounts could use different implementations (smart contract standards) their is a default one provided based on what Manifold and Future Primitive has worked on and have audited. But theoritically you can create your own implementation which modifies functionalities. 

There's also opportunity to add extensions onto tokenbound accounts that can add utility such as nesting, staking, burn, etc. 

Extensions are going to be much safer and easier to build and use. While implementations will be more custom contracts and will have more flexibility but will require more resources and audits.Fedor Linnik says I meant a bit different thing. Can the same NFT have Account 1, Account 2 and etc.?Fedor Linnik says Awesome tree BTW! Made me think of recording family trees as NFTsJayden says Yes, every NFT can have an infinite number of accountsFedor Linnik says Oh, that's awesome! Thank you for clarifying.Jaimin | Caddi ㅤ says Gm Gm!Benny Giang says gm!Steve J says hey @jaimin_building !Jaimin | Caddi ㅤ says Hey Steve, figured you’d be here!

Excited to explore some cool 6551 ideas with everyone here 🙂Lad says gmgmkaiyan 🌐⚡️ says GM all! Got a qq, what's the cleanest pattern you know for updating a single NFT metadata within a collection without re-uploading an entire IPFS batch? I have some approaches but want to double check if they're sound.Jayden says Is the existing metadata on IPFS? And do you have control over per-token metadata URIs at the contract level? Is the contract immutable or upgradable?kaiyan 🌐⚡️ says for a new contract, not existing. Upgradeable. Control over per-token metadata URI.kaiyan 🌐⚡️ says As in the tokenURI function can include custom logicBenny Giang says welcome @trent_e  from https://jpg.space/Jayden says Nice, that definitely makes it easier. One way would be to add a storage mapping from tokenId to tokenURI and return that value if set for a given token ID. Can add a utility function for setting the URI per-token that emits an ERC-4906 MetadataUpdated event (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4906) so changes are reflected on marketplaceskaiyan 🌐⚡️ says Got it, thanks! Yeah, I was thinking individual IPFS uploads for each token metadata is the most obvious but wanted to check there wasn't a more "elegant" solution. Thx for the ERC-4906 reference! Definitely helpful :)Benny Giang says ✿♥‿♥✿Benny Giang says hi everyone!! here's the weekly dev call please add this to your gcal. tentatively it'll be every week on thursday evening but we can adjust based on those who can show up

https://www.twitch.tv/futureprimitivexyzFabien Allanic says Marc M | Animoca says Is there anything preventing a token’s owner address to also be a wallet that is bound to the token? I’m wondering if it’s possible for a token to somehow own itself?Jayden says This is possible, and something that the EIP leaves open for account implementations to handle as they see fit (see: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#ownership-cycles). If an NFT owns itself, the NFT and the account contents are essentially burned. The Tokenbound account implementation provides some contract level protection against this, but it's difficult to fully prevent on-chain because of the large search space. Clients are encouraged to prevent users from accidentally introducing ownership cycles. Hope that helps :)Benny Giang says AKA OWNERSHIP CYCLES = "DEATH LOOP"Fedor Linnik says A tokenbound wallet of an NFT lost in a limbo sounds like a cool burn address XDJayden says That's exactly why we didn't prohibit this at the proposal level, seems like some very cool use cases for ownership cycles as a burn mechanicYeong says Someone make a portal reference NFT and let it loop till Mach 50Yeong says Yeong says Portal Bound AccountsBenny Giang says legit that's what will happen...Benny Giang says Benny Giang says Spreading the good word at NFT BC this week in VancouverLad says Hey guys, very excited by tokenbound NFTs. I believe this enables strong new use cases going further than 4337.

Many financial use cases are made possible by this, and I've been thinking about said use cases these past months (without relying on a solution, only in a "speculative" way)

I'm non techie but I talked about erc6551 with some friends at some layer2s / protocols and they'd be interested to engage in talks with some of you to see how to foster adoption of such a great erc.

Feel free to hit me up 🙂Jayden says Glad to hear @crypto_Lad! Would love to help support some of these use cases you're thinking of. Feel free to invite your friends to this working group, or DM me if you want to grab some time for a call.

https://twitter.com/BennyGiang/status/1651968453480431616?s=20zomglings says AFabien Allanic says ABenny Giang says interesting!!Benny Giang says Lots of folks on twitter going for BBenny Giang says Do you think the wallet icon gets confusing with your metamask wallet? 

For (B) does you feel like that icon represents copies of the Azuki?Krisma says first looks like a wallet icon - by the logic makes sense

second looks like a gallery of many images put together, UI like you would see it in any OS

Both make sense, depending on the angle

instead of asking nerds like us, ask people who mostly use instagram and facebook for their daily routine. That's what I do whenever UI/UX challenge occurs.Sia says @bennyg  Does it need to say nft? What if there eth inside or other coins ?  Just an idea but did you explore just numerical value base on floor price of all additional assets it holds ? It's a quick way to understand how much value is nft vs what it holdsBenny Giang says Interesting idea! Most wallets like Metamask seperate Assets (coins) and NFTs. Being that TBAs can hold either assets or NFTs we originally had the word "Assets" but... we felt it was confusing because does 10 ETH = 1 asset? we know that 1 NFT = 1 asset. So what would the total be?

If we go for the other option where we just show total value, I guess we can basically sum up all the nested NFT's floor price + total coins and it would just display an ETH value like "10.5 ETH" but I wonder if people might get confused and think that would be the price of the NFT (which could be the reaction we want?)Sia says Good point, but maybe you do special TBA icon next to value and build brand value around the ideamind says The wallet icon without “40 NFTs” would be quite clear to me that this NFT is a wallet that can hold assets. 

Maybe if you hover over the icon, it shows a list of assets with “show more”? Will the detail page have a section that shows all the assets in the wallet?Benny Giang says Benny Giang says ^ example if we displayed summary of ETH based on everything nested inside of this Azuki and the relation betweent he actual Azuki's listed sale priceJayden says Love the icon on this one!Krisma says then again, many NFTs floor can have one blur bid, but get translated into many NFTs valued at that bid that cant cover all of those, easy to confuse actual valueKrisma says bro you give me that icon all I see is playstationJayden says 😂 you're rightBenny Giang says @mindapi on the SAPIENZ project this is how we are thinking of displaying it. 

The fingerprint is representing identity for the NFT and it shows some of the assets inside of the TBA.

However, this UI might not work for Opensea because it's a bit too heavy I thinkBenny Giang says true... I think displaying total value might create certain behaviours of valuation but may not actually educate you on what's inside of the TBA or how many things are inside of the TBAKrisma says each of those circles are nested nft?Benny Giang says yaNΞMØ says That’s coolKrisma says not opposed but I saw many interfaces where this exact display is meant to show how many members/users are "in", a group chat, meeting, etc

Instantly made me think these are avatars of users that claimed this collectionBenny Giang says ahhh... interesting never thought of that! so it can be mistake as some sort of social graph of ownership rather than what's inside of the TBANΞMØ says Why not just have 1 stacked circle icon with the +amount nested, instead of the side by side circles.Sia says why does # of nfts matter, 50 vs. 100 nfts doesnt tell me most important info which is value of TBA in aggregate, i think the hover over idea that was suggested was great bc then can show bit more into what its in itConner says # of nfts may be more relevant for some applications like a game where you want to know at a glance if buying a character comes with its assets. Hover for more info would let you show both $/ETH value and nft counts as high level statsKrisma says let me add someKrisma says Krisma says Krisma says less is moreSia says # still doesnt tell if its right ones, you still would ahve to dig deeper. at least with $value, i now where mix of value is coming from between nft itself vs. what it holds. thats actually relevant infoNΞMØ says CKrisma says I think "NFTs" isnt required when you see these on a marketplace that trades NFTs only

same as its obvious if you'd apply same ui to instagram - a platform that displays pictureskaiyan 🌐⚡️ says I think that without text "40 NFTs" it's not intuitive. This is a new pattern so there is a little education required for the consumer.kaiyan 🌐⚡️ says Whatever the icon is.NΞMØ says Can clicking the icon bring down a descriptive inventory of what’s contained? Or is it limited due to the interface?Krisma says its a new standard, people will need to catch up a bit. That number alone - assuming no other will be displayed on the nft, wont be confusing after bare minimum time spent to understand what it really meansKrisma says to put it in a context: I will learn what this means, since potentially knowing whether some NFTs contain other NFTs - can bring me a bargain of a sale, vs buying one without any numbers 

nft psyops 101Benny Giang says I think the number alone might get confused with quantity that exists on 1155sKrisma says Fair enough, forgot about thatBenny Giang says I think the main tension that exists from both perspectives are stemming from:

1. Total value assessment 
2. # of assets owned/held

In my mind it's analogous to mutual fund portfolio value assessment of a mix of stocks and bonds and game inventory systems where quantity of items denote some sort of nesting.

Being that NFTs can exist in both plains it gets tricky when trying to summarize it within a single icon/numberBenny Giang says Benny Giang says Benny Giang says maybe... the combination of the two could be the answerBenny Giang says Sia says yes, but if we stick this mutual fund example....no one says or cares that my mutual fund owns 150 stocks vs. the other one that owns 20 stocks. they say its $value is this.Fedor Linnik says I think the issue with the total ETH value is that not every NFT is very liquid so sometimes the floor price doesn’t correspond to the real value. Maybe, best offer value is a more realistic option in this case. 

But I’d rather display this in either a separate icon or just inside the NFT’s profile. Don’t think it’s crucial for a potential buyer to see it from the preview icon.Benny Giang says @S08ird true! in the context of a marketplace like Opensea where the main activity is trading. Value assessment might be what people care more about.

@JJKoolAid we have ideas for the NFT detailed view. That is an area that we can show a lot more for sure. Wanted to start off on the top level thumbnail since that's what most people will use to scan through NFTs in order to better understand what's in itFedor Linnik says I’ve also thought of an icon with an arrow pointing inside a folder to indicate there is something inside, but it’s conventionally used for “downloads”Benny Giang says here's an example of what we think the NFT detail page could look like.Sia says i think the hover / drill down to details of nfts is important, just saying its 2nd step for someone to do it properly as an experienceSia says like what @mindapi said earlier in terms of detail pageFedor Linnik says Got it! Might be relevant then. But I’d still suggest a minimum value based on offers. I think OpenSea Pro already lets you see portfolio value calculated this way.Sia says ya, not strong views on how to come up with value other than most convervative way to do itBenny Giang says like this? @mindapikaiyan 🌐⚡️ says This is the best so far imokaiyan 🌐⚡️ says Just be careful of integer overflow lolNΞMØ says I’m not sure that value assessment is as important as validating authenticity of the NFTs themselves.Krisma says I get the intention, but I hate this much symbols at once

40 NFTs will do just fine tbhNΞMØ says Investors would care more about value.. but we’re trying to bring the gamers in right? 👽Benny Giang says I guess the only confusing part about this one is the ETH part.

Does 10.5 ETH represent the total value of the 40 NFTs and ETH nested?

Does the 10.5 ETH represent how much ETH is inside of the NFT?

Does the 10.5 ETH represent the value of this Azuki? 

Does the 10.5 represent a bid or offer on the azuki?Krisma says Ya hence I'd just drop itKrisma says Parallel did that through their interface, feature was dropped in some next iteration of the interfaceBenny Giang says Do you have a pic of itKrisma says No, might try to find laterFedor Linnik says I think you can shorten it by replacing words with icons 

Or it can open up when you point or click on the wallet icon. 

If we shrink it to just a wallet icon, it could be interesting to signal the contents’ value with color. Like, the higher is the value the greener is the cloud. Then, if you want to see the actual value you just click on the icon. But dunno if it’s intuitive enoughmind says Yes plus a hover with a description like “This NFT is a wallet. Learn more”. I believe this  works well if there’s a section in the detail page that shows the assets.zomglings says @jaydenwindle : I've been thinking more about ERC6551 since our call last week, especially about tokenbound accounts in the context of web3 games.

Two thoughts:

1. One of the problems with the NFT Inventory contract is in how to handle backpacks. These are storage positions which can accept any item and based on the level of your backpack you may have different numbers of these positions. An ERC6551 contract with an appropriately modified onERC721Received callback could be really good for this.

2. One of the leading patterns in fully on-chain games is to transfer ownership of your NFT to a game contract. This pattern doesn't play well with ERC6551 for many reasons. I'm trying to understand if this could be solved with a custom ERC6551 account implementation.Krisma says Re 2, why custom, when you can just pick what item gets transferred out of 6551 in case you need it in-game, while the rest stays? 

Until you need the main nft that holds the restKrisma says Then the question would be, can I transfer the ownership from the until-now main NFT onto a one below, so I can transfer now the "main" as it's a 721 game item I needzomglings says When a character enters a game built this way, the game takes ownership of the character NFT, which means that the game also gets control of the tokenbound account.zomglings says So the user has to manage items manually when they enter the game?zomglings says *before they enter the gameKrisma says Ya I got you, hence why I thought of main ownership transfer

So not whole 6551 gets owned by the game, but rather an exact itemKrisma says And if game requires whole 6551 pack, then so it'll be it if that's how it's builtzomglings says That changes how these games have to be designed. Too much friction. There are several very good reasons that so many on-chain games are built with transfer of character ownership as the core game entry mechanic.Krisma says How so? You have now for months infra with game inventory wallets and separate user wallets that require transfers in and outKrisma says Axie, stepn, no need to go further into more advanced onchain oneszomglings says The games you mentioned are not on-chain games.Benny Giang says Welcome @oneofthemanymattsKrisma says Ya but the logic remains the same transfer wiseKrisma says You gotta deposit in order for item to be usable, no?zomglings says Most of those hybrid games have a flag on each token that denotes whether they are in-game or not. They don't actually transfer ownership. Not sure about stepn though.zomglings says Also need to think through different delegation models for ERC721 tokens and what they entail for ERC6551.Jayden says These are great questions! A few thoughts:

1. You're right that 6551 has no concept of equippable slots. Modifying the receiver is one way to implement, but perhaps a better way is to have an external contract that manages the mapping between items in the 6551 account and the slots they are equipped to. 6551 handles the "does this nft own this item" problem, the mapping contract would solve the "is this nft able to use this item in a way that matches the in-game logic" problem.

2. Would love to hear more about why this pattern doesn't play well with 6551! If the game contract owns t he NFT, the game contract has full control over the nft wallet, which seems like a nice feature as it can manage inventory on the token's behalf. Additionally, since each token has a static wallet, storing the nft in the game contract might not be necessary (since it seems like there would be less reasons to restrict transfers). The execution permission on the account could be delegated to the game logic contract, allowing transfers to happen at any time without interfering with game logiczomglings says 1. The NFT Inventory contract stores the mapping between ERC721 tokens and items. It also assumes ownership of items: https://github.com/G7DAO/contracts/blob/develop/contracts/facets/InventoryFacet.sol

The custom implementation I was considering for an ERC6551 account would expose the inventory interface so players could easily equip/unequip by making calls directly to the 6551 account (by proxy).zomglings says 2. re: not storing the NFT in the game contract that still imposes game design constraints. For example, we build our game mechanics without assumptions on the ERC721 implementation - and we can't assume that a player is using a tokenbound account with their NFT.Jayden says Would love to hear more about some of the constraints that are important to you right now. If every NFT has a tokenbound account by default regardless of NFT implementation, why can't that be assumed?zomglings says Most important factor for us is that we can deploy our game mechanics into any game world in a consistent manner.

Every NFT has a tokenbound account (in principle) but that doesn't mean that the current owner of that NFT is aware of the tokenbound account or gives their consent to send new game assets to that tokenbound account.Jayden says Totally agree re: game world consistency. Why does the NFT owner need to be aware of the tokenbound account or give consent to receiving assets? The game is able to deploy the account on behalf of the token holder, and is able to permissionlessly send assets to it. If the token holder interacts with the game via their tokenbound account or transfers their NFT to the game contract, isn't that implicit consent to use it? I guess I don't see how assuming the (already guaranteed) existence of a tokenbound account is any different than the asssumptions that are already being madezomglings says It's not mathematically equivalent to send assets to the tokenbound account and to send assets to the owner:
1. Someone has to submit an additional transaction to deploy the ERC6551 account.
2. If the owner of the NFT wants to make use of the assets that were transferred to the tokenbound account in some other context, they would have to submit a transaction to first transfer the assets from the tokenbound account to their account before doing whatever they wanted to do.zomglings says Interesting - this also raised another question.

Can you actually put game logic into onERC721Received?

Any tokens transferred to the tokenbound account prior to the smart contract deployment would not be subject to the game constraints. Could be a path for game-breaking exploits.zomglings says I guess it would require putting those constraints in the account deployment code?zomglings says (Also not using safeTransferFrom would introduce the same class of problems.)Benny Giang says Benny Giang says If you’re in Vancouver come by DCTRL we are working on 6551 stuff :)Jayden says I don't think this is quite the case, because:
1. assets can be received before the ERC6551 account is deployed
2. the owner of the NFT can make use of the assets in its token bound account in any context directly from the account, no need to withdraw the assets firstJayden says Correct, which is partially why I'm not sure putting game logic in the receiver handler is the best solution. I don't think it makes sense to enforce game constraints at the level of the account, I think it makes sense to enforce game constraints at the level of the game logic contract. By assuming the account exists and is the means for determining ownership (not utility) for each in-game item, this means that the game logic doesn't need to manage ownershipJayden says I don't think this is necessary so long as the account isn't the source of truth for game logic constraints. For example, imagine I have an NFT that is compatible with two separate game worlds. If game logic constraints around valid items is enforced at the account level, I would need a separate account to interact with each game. However, if the item usage constraints are at the game logic level, I can use a single account for both games. This is simpler from both a user and a platform perspective (as each NFT owns all gaming-related assets in one place). Each game can still validate ownership of items and use of items according to it's own logic, while letting the NFT remain soverign over the assets it chooses to own. Would love to understand any challenges around using this model that you think might arise :)Benny Giang says @mindapi like this right?mind says Yes! What do you think?Benny Giang says ya i think it puts the responsibility on the buyers to go to the detail page in order to see what's inside of a TBA. I like it because it's probably the best move for a phase 1 introduction to the idea of a TBA without confusing existing NFT owners with too much info. Just like how the ETH icon is simply just a reminder that this NFT is on Ethereum, the wallet icon is just there to remind you that this NFT is a wallet.Conner says Just dropped a comment on the ERC in the magicians forum! Topic is on improving devX and gas for moving NFTs of nested accounts. Curious for feedback 🙂
https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-6551-non-fungible-token-bound-accounts/13030/61?u=connerone of the many matts says QQ for the salt is that just like a namespace to double-guarantee that there wouldn't be any collisions between all of these potential walletsJayden says Good question! Salts let you have multiple accounts per wallet implementation. It works similar to salts for generating wallet addresses from a seed phrase. Also allows for vanity addresses / stealth addresses if people want to use thatJayden says Amazing, thanks for the comment! Will take a look and respond this afternoon :)Benny Giang says hi @spengrah want to share your question about 1155 heremind says https://twitter.com/spicypaprika_/status/1652049844268138498?s=20

Did another exploration on 4337+6551. Is anyone working on something like this?Jayden says Definitely! A mobile client for 6551 accounts is on the roadmap, love this way of visualizing it. The Tokenbound account implementation is 4337-compatible out of the box, which enables lots of cool use cases like this :)Benny Giang says this is super neat! love the exploration, on first glance i thought the tx history was a bit too busy but I think it makes sense when people want to scan through all the history. I think the power of all of this is NFT history. Which right now doesn't exist beyond just a transfer function.mind says @bennyg absolutely!Jayden says @symmtry69 this is awesome, thanks for the comment! Definitely a use case that should have clear solutions. Responded in the thread with some thoughts, would love your feedback :)Spencer Graham 🧢 says thanks for the invite! Very excited about 6551 and the general concept of giving NFTs their own wallets.

I'm very keen to understand the degree to which 6551 does or could support 1155s. My main project (Hats Protocol) makes heavy use of non-transferable 1155s, and we're highly interested in giving each its own wallet (recognizing that there are some considerations related to variable supply and 1-of-n security models).Jayden says Welcome @spengrah! 1155 support is an open question at the moment, primarily because it complicates the model significantly if there can be more than one owner per token ID. In your case, do the 1155 tokens have multiple owners or a single owner?Spencer Graham 🧢 says either, depending on the token. Each token (aka "hat") can be configured with a max supply up to 2^32. Many just have 1 owner, but many have multiple. This does make things harder to handle, primarily the 1-of-n security model I mentioned.

Our current thinking is to give our users multiple options, with the simple wallet implementation (ideally via 6551; we've hacked around with Mech) being the 1-of-n flavor.Spencer Graham 🧢 says I think I saw somewhere that the intent of 6551 is to allow for multiple implementations. If that remains the case, I think that would help make 1155 support acceptible, since there wouldn't be an expectation of canonical wallet address for a given NFT and the default would be for users to choose.Jayden says This is definitely correct, it would be quite simple to spin up an implementation that works with 1155s. The asterisk here is that it would require either a) a slightly non-standard account implementation or b) changes to the standard account interface within the proposal. The account interface currently specifies an "owner" function which returns a single canonical owner address. Since 1155s that can have multiple owners don't have a single canonical owner, this starts to break down. Would love to hear more about your thinking around 1-of-n execution, I'm very curious to hear the use case for allowing anyone who owns an 1155 token to be able to execute on behalf of all holdersJayden says Love the multiple options approach, 6551 is designed to accommodate diverse implementations for precisely this reasonSpencer Graham 🧢 says tbh there aren't many good ones. Our current thinking is to have a 1 of n option that should be used in the case where there is a single token owner, ie in practice it becomes 1 of 1. But we'd still call it 1 of n so users understand the security model and don't accidentally do something dangerousSpencer Graham 🧢 says I quite like Mech's isOperator() approach. In our case, we have that check the msg.sender's balance of the relevant 1155Wilkins Chung says Our thinking is that:
1. 6551’s can hold 1155’s. 
2. Like @jaydenwindle mentions multiple owners makes owner permissions impossible unless you break out the 1155 into identifiable units. The way we would approach it is to have a burn for 721 to get a 6551. Or a claim for a 721 to get a 6551.Wilkins Chung says The balance thing you mention is interesting if it’s a threshold of ownership that allows action. But is more like a dao mechanism.Spencer Graham 🧢 says This works mechanically, and I think it also fits (my interpretation of) the spirit of NFT-controlled accounts, which is that the point is to make the NFT an abstraction for the account and reduce the importance of addressesWilkins Chung says Outside the scope of 6551 but could be an interesting approach to a dao controlled wallet based on 1155 balance.Spencer Graham 🧢 says for our purposes, balance of hat tokens can only ever be 0 or 1, so its a bit simplifiedJayden says Yeah, we've thought through this at some length and have had a hard time coming up with a good use case for each holder being able to execute on behalf of all holdersWilkins Chung says Right. But we couldn’t assume that. But I see what you’re saying. And in this case the more general parallel to an 1155 would be a dao controlled wallet.Wilkins Chung says Where the majority or any threshold owner could executeWilkins Chung says “Wallet per token id”Jayden says I do as well, but it also complicates the model and introduces a number of extra edge cases. Accounts are non-fungible by nature, trying to use a fungible asset to control then gets messy quicklySpencer Graham 🧢 says and then you're implementing a multisig, which for good reason nobody wants to do 🤣Wilkins Chung says I mean, theoretically, 6551 could support this just as long as your implementation modifies the owner check.Jayden says I do like the claim approach, as it lets you prove that you meet certain criteria in order to transfer ownership of the account to yourself. Since no extra logic is needed on the 721 side, this seems pretty low liftSpencer Graham 🧢 says yea I guess this is the right question to ask. Is there a pathway to creating an 1155 implementation that can be compatible with 6551, even if the main 6551 implementation does not support them.Wilkins Chung says I don’t see why not. Your implementation could have the exec gate be based on a balance threshold.Jayden says Is this guaranteed at the 1155 contract level? If so, this would be simple to create a custom implementation for, as it's functionally single ownershipWilkins Chung says It s just that 6551 enforces one wallet per token id. Which for this purpose is what you want anyways.Wilkins Chung says Or one wallet owner per token. The definition of owner is up to you.Spencer Graham 🧢 says in our case, token balances are enforced as binary. Though multiple addresses can have a balance of the same token idJayden says Ah I see - max one per walletWilkins Chung says Don’t see why you couldn’t have an 1155 implementation that works with 6551 then.Jayden says You could abuse the salt value here, and read it at the implementation levelJayden says So salt would become the owner address, and the implementation would restrict calls to the owner if their balance is non-zeroWilkins Chung says @jaydenwindle don’t think you even need to right? Can just instantiate the wallet for the token and specify an ownership check based on balance.Jayden says I think you'd need separate salt values anyways, because otherwise all holders of the same tokenId would share the same account addressWilkins Chung says Wait. I’m saying that 6551 support for 1155 can be strictly one “owner” per 6551 token. Where owner can be whatever logic you want. (Balance threshold, etc)Wilkins Chung says So in @spengrah ‘s case the owner is balance > 0 because he enforced 1 or 0 at his 1155 implementation.Spencer Graham 🧢 says i think this would be an ok assumption for us. Incorporating owner address into the salt would tightly couple owner with the token, which would break our revocation functionality.Wilkins Chung says And in another one, where supply of token is > 1, it’s whatever logic or threshold the dev decides. Maybe multiple ppl can execute but that’s fine. Or maybe nobody can execute unless the accumulate > 50%Wilkins Chung says The only thing 6551 enforced is one wallet per token per seed. Doesn’t specify controllability of execution.Jayden says Yes, hear you here and very doable w/ slightly non-standard implementation. Would need a way to query total supply for a tokenId on the 1155 token, which isn't part of the 1155 spec unfortunatelyJayden says Yes, precisely. Can share a wallet if you can choose a canonical owner. With 1-of-n there is no canonical ownerWilkins Chung says Nope. But if you’re providing your own implementation you might already know the total supply. In @spengrah he knows it’s 0-1. And he can restrict creation to only his tokens.Wilkins Chung says (Via a restriction on the init call)Wilkins Chung says Do we want to call this out in the spec @jaydenwindle ?Jayden says Totally, a good example of this is the ENS namewrapper upgrade. All ENS names are 1155s, but because the 1155 contract implements ownerOf it works with 6551 example accounts out of the box. Can do something similar if you don't want to build a custom wallet implementationJayden says That's a good idea, I think it's worth taking through both the canonical owner and the salt approachJayden says Yes, can also do this with custom accountJayden says Would love to understand how that breaks things. With the salt method, revocation would mean you lose execution access to the 6551 account. Since each account is tied to an individual holder, that seems line it should fit the model?Wilkins Chung says So I guess, yes, 6551works with 1155 with caveats.Wilkins Chung says Btw. I find the dao/threshold permission model pretty interesting.Jayden says Awesome! Was thinking through what spec changes might be needed to do this, glad there seem to be ways it works out of the boxWilkins Chung says Imagine an 1155 account where the mechanic is > 50%.  And it has a bunch of super valuable assets.Wilkins Chung says And there’s 1000 of the 1155 token.Jayden says Same. Wonder what ERC20 support might look like. Seems pretty similar conceptually to 1155 with zero tokenIdJayden says Yeah this is super neatWilkins Chung says I guess for erc20 tokenID 0 (or whatever) would be fine.Jayden says Obv this is way outside of intended scope but interesting thought experimentSpencer Graham 🧢 says in Hats Protocol, hats (tokens) represent roles. Our goal is to give roles a wallet, abstracted away from who is currently filling the role (has a balance of the token). Adding the owner address to the salt breaks that abstraction.Wilkins Chung says Nothing prevents the implementation from saying only token X address Y can create.Jayden says Ah, that makes senseWilkins Chung says Ya.  In that case what I proposed should work.Jayden says Yep, agreedWilkins Chung says Ya. No changes needed. Updating eip with these examples and usages would be good.Jayden says Will do!Spencer Graham 🧢 says sounds great - thanks guys!Spencer Graham 🧢 says appreciate you thinking through this with me 🙏Wilkins Chung says Do we have a recommended owner check sig? Might be useful for display support in exposing execution interfaces.Jayden says Likewise!Wilkins Chung says Again, no need to modify any of the code, but a recommended interface may help with integrations, even in this case. Like someone can login, can call owner check to expose transfer or execution interfaces.Jayden says Can you expand on this?Wilkins Chung says Wondering if the eip should have a recommendation that implementations implement something like 

canExecute(address)

- note: terrible naming. 

Use case for UX would be to show/hide options to issue commands to nft wallet.Wilkins Chung says I can imagine a bunch of implementations adding their own function to toggle UXJayden says Should be able to check this via a simulated execution call, no?Jayden says Unless you want to use that info on chainWilkins Chung says Ya. I was thinking the same (that’s what I would do right now). Wondering if theres value for an on chain method (thinking out loud)Jayden says Yeah, there may be. The alternative would be to try the execution and just let the implementation handle the revertJayden says An alternative would be checking for a valid signature, assuming that the implementation uses the same access control for signing + execution. Requires a sig thoughKrisma says hey tokenbound fam, Visual Machina that I am creating is doing its first steps in public, next several segments do include ERC6551 (obviously), hope you will like what is coming! 

If anyone wants to partner up with their NFT collections for VM's Ghosted mint, dm meKrisma says https://twitter.com/visualmachina/status/1652382281145757701Jayden says Awesome! Let us know how we can support :)Jayden says Would also love to hear about some of your planned use cases for 6551!NΞMØ says Question; would an NFT be able to be minted directly to a token wallet?Jayden says Definitely! You can either call the mint function directly from the token's wallet, or use the mint to function (if it's available) to mint with your EOA but transfer to your token account in one txNΞMØ says And a Followup question; could that nft be “soul bound” to that NFT?Jayden says Of course!NΞMØ says Dang that’s really fire..NΞMØ says Could use that feature to collect badges like a Boy ScoutNΞMØ says Thanks for your response!Jayden says Totally! This is one of the use cases we're really excited aboutNΞMØ says Would like to use this feature to develop a community that can earn accomplishment medals and ranking. Cool stuffNΞMØ says Maybe it can evolve the parent NFT, like a dynamic tokenJayden says Totally!Jayden says Would love to see this builtR says question
Can erc 6551 nft replace metamask?
For users who do not have a web3 wallet, can they have the function of nft+ wallet at the same time by sending nft?
But they still have to create a wallet like metamask before accepting it, right?0xMitty says Every action need a signature, metamask or any web3 wallet is the 3rd party to sign the action. So basiclly erc6551 still needs web3 walletFedor Linnik says Hey guys! 

Would you be interested in having a debate/discussion with Bruno from RMRK team which is behind EIP-6059? 6059 is trying to solve more or less the same problem as 6551 but with a bit different approach. I'm in the same NFT-related chat with Bruno and we discussed both standards a little. He says he'd be open to a discussion or collaboration. So I thought it could be a good idea to mediate it.Jayden says @JJKoolAid Would love to have a discussion! I don't think it needs to be in the style of a debate - 6059 is great, the two standards are compatible out of the box and not competitive. If you'd like to invite me to the NFT chat feel free, otherwise we could set up a group chat just for that purposeWilkins Chung says 6059 is tangential imo. 6551 allows for smart wallets to be controlled by nft’s and goes far beyond nesting tokens.Jayden says +1 on this - 6551 goes well beyond nested ownership and opens up a lot of other unique possibilities for NFTsWilkins Chung says 6551 makes it so that nft’s are effectively sovereign entities. Meaning they can hold and act on anything in the ethereum ecosystem, including erc20’s and other smart contracts.Fedor Linnik says Great! The chat is token-gated (part of Lobster DAO) so I can't add anyone in there, but I'll ask what works best for him.Wilkins Chung says The intent of 6551 is not just to nest tokens. But allow nft’s to have control of assets and actions. You “can” nest tokens with 6551 but that’s just a subset of what it represents or it can do (even though some of the initial use cases are similar to nesting token ownership, like clothing)Wilkins Chung says He can join this chat if he wishes @JJKoolAidWilkins Chung says For example, we’re using 6551’s as an identity mechanism for a few things we’re working on.Fedor Linnik says Sure, I'll drop the linkJayden says Yes, totally!Jayden says Can you join by owning a lobsterdao NFT? If so, would love to pick one up and hop in thereFedor Linnik says So is 6059 devoid of the control fuctionality 6551 has?Wilkins Chung says Yup. 6059 is an extension of of 721 and focuses solely on constructs around 721.Jayden says Bruno would have a better grasp on this than I would, but from my reading of the standard 6059 allows NFTs that implement the standard to nest other NFTs that implement the standard inside of them. There's no NFT execution logic beyond nested ownership of specific assets. It's also not compatible with ERC20/ERC1155 tokens without wrapping them in an ERC721 tokenFedor Linnik says It's a subchat where you need the Lobster DAO NFT + either Based Ghoul or BlockArt NFT. But we can just wait for him to answer. I think he's in Europe and it's already late night there  

https://guild.xyz/nft-interstateWilkins Chung says The objectives are pretty different @JJKoolAid 

The concept of tokens controlling or owning other tokens is a subset of what 6551’s design is for.Wilkins Chung says For example, 6551 can be (and will likely) be used as a way to tie identity to something like an ENS. Whereby if the ens is resold all the stuff goes along with it.Fedor Linnik says Get it! 

I'm not a dev so don't fully understand all the technicalities, but, intuitively, I also find the 6551 minimum amount of constraints a better primitive for building on top. It also seems that many projects are going to require custom implementations anyways so there will also be a demand for extra standards embracing the most common use cases such as inventory slots, so the the toolkit built by RMRK can still be quite relevant even if 6551 gets the adoptionWilkins Chung says Right. 6551 is more of a protocol level spec. The implementation can and should vary, and in fact, theoretically could be a 6059-like implementation.Fedor Linnik says I think accounts which contents are accessible/redeemable only by burning the parent NFT can definitely be a popular thingFedor Linnik says Btw, it made think about the ownership transfer of TBAs. What if it was possible to reassign ownership from NFT A to NFT B? Could be quite handy for saving gas for instanceWilkins Chung says To do that, probably best to have a 721 nft wallet that is owned by nft a. That way nft a can send the 721 wallet and all the assets along.Fedor Linnik says But is it theoretically possible with the 6551 registry design?Wilkins Chung says Ya. I’m giving an example of how you would.Jayden says Theoretically possible with a custom account implementation as wellWilkins Chung says Yup. You’d have to track ownership chain separately.Fedor Linnik says Cool! Do you expect more standardized implementations emerge if 6551 gets the adoption or it's more likely that most of projects will be making their custom builds?Jayden says The challenge with building your own implementation is that there are pretty high security requirements since you're holding user assets. For some projects that will make sense, and for other projects it might make more sense to use one of the open-source implementations that have been built. But the 6551 spec is specifically designed to allow you to bring your own implementation if you want toKrisma says Bruno is also in lobster kingdom - group gated behind lobster dao onlyKrisma says dmed u his @ u guys talk it throughLad says I thought a lot about many such use cases.. if anyone is down to schedule some work sessions lmk :D non techie thoLad says But I’ll happily dig with youJayden says Would love to see some community work sessions around this!Jack says This is awesome - keen to come to the next Dev Call :)!Jayden says Great to have you here!Conner says https://twitter.com/symmtry69/status/1653094650633424900?s=20
consolidated some ideas in my head and in the chat over the weekend, curious if this framing also speaks to othersJayden says This is amazing - love it!Fedor Linnik says I think RMRK that we discussed yesterday came up with a similar concept. They break down possible applications here 

https://www.sbt2.io/Fedor Linnik says Once I had an idea of making an SBT nft collection and depositing each piece in a separate Emblem Vault NFT, so the SBT is tradeable till it's redeemed XDConner says Ooh interesting thought on conditional transferability. Assuming that people claim from the Vault at which point it doesn’t leave their wallet?Fedor Linnik says Emblem Vault lets you mint NFTs which work as keys to a wallet (or array of wallets across different blockchains). When you burn the parent NFT you receive all the private keys. They’re using an off-chain solution for this, but the idea is that the platform itself doesn’t have any access to the keys generated. 

I think Emblem Vault is being used for Rare Pepe cards and Ordinals to make them trade able on ETHFedor Linnik says The downside is that you can only mint such a parent NFT using the EV smart contractJayden says Yep, there are lots of cool applications when you point soulbound tokens at a transferrable wallet!Jayden says Oh interesting! Will have to take a lookJayden says Also, we'd love to host an impromptu community session tomorrow to talk about some of the ways ERC-6551 can be integrated at the marketplace level to protect against fraud. We'll present some of our thinking on the subject and would love to gather feedback from you all. If you're interested in joining, please react to this message so we know how many folks to expectJayden says cc @wwhchung @emo_eth @symmtry69 @z0age as this might be interesting to you all :)Wilkins Chung says My birthday tomorrow so prob won’t be able to do that, lol. 

But my thinking for marketplaces was the nonce approach at an implementation level to allow for easy check of modified state between offer creation and offer acceptance.

Marketplace would need to intelligently disclose approvals as well.Jayden says Oh man, happy birthday! It will be recorded so no worries if you can't make itBenny Giang says happy birthday @wwhchung !Jayden says Yep, this is still the case. The talk will mostly be about the nuts and bolts of how exactly marketplace support can be added to existing marketplaces today (without waiting for marketplaces to adopt the standard)Benny Giang says RSVP by saving the calendar https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1/r?cid=Y185OTNjZmNjOGRjNWE5MDdlM2Y1N2M4YWI0NTQwYzRiMTVhNTQ4ODc2YmQ0OWMyMWEwYmExY2RkMGU2MDE4ZjVhQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20Jessica xian says Happy Birthday🎂～～NΞMØ says YesssBenny Giang says welcome all!Benny Giang says Today at 10am PST (1.5 hrs from now) we are having a discussion around marketplace integrations. Anyone who is a smart contract/protocol dev we'd love for you to come and contribute to the discussion. How it's relevant to the wider ERC 6551 dev community

- Discuss Opensea Seaport zones
- Discuss trade offs with existing UI and potential fraud vectors

Is there a place I can reference a recording or notes?Jayden says Hey all good! Unfortunately we had a bit of a mishap with the recording, so weren't able to grab one. Going to record a recap video and share here this afternoon insteadBenny Giang says welcome @smsunartoJayden says Awesome to have you here @smsunarto! Would love any feedback / comments you have on 6551 esp in light of your work on Persona0xplus7🐰 says Gm Scott!Alanah says Hey folks! Alanah here - design @ future primitive and working with the team on tokenbound :) just posted this UI exploration, would love your thoughts! https://twitter.com/alanahlam/status/1653488052533366784?s=46Alanah says Also this fun “portfolio pack” exploration https://twitter.com/alanahlam/status/1653505832729083905?s=46Benny Giang says Hi all!! Jayden and I will be in Lisbon May 10-15, we're partnering up with Lens Protocol @OxChristina, Bradley, @donosonaumczuk, Nader and team on a hackathon prize for those building ERC 6551 + Lens

Ideas:
- Lens handle in every NFT TBA
- Lens profile has a TBA that holds all comments, likes, posts on Lens
- Lens profile talking to Lens profile using decentralized messaging
- Lens profile reimagined as a game character where engagement = evolution via TBA 
- And more :) 

Let us know if you'll be around! Would love to organize something :)Yeong says see uJayden says Hey all! Here's a quick recap of the community call today in case you weren't able to join. Apologies for the lack of recording, we'll make sure to hit the record button on the next one. Feel free to ask any questions or provide any feedback as always :)Jack says @kayunee and I will be around and would be keen to meet! :))Jayden says Let's do it!Jean-Luc says I'll also be around and keen to join!Megabyte 🧱🚀 says gm 

I am trying to implement a basic mint functionality using the reference repo.... but while calling the executeCall function I am getting Not token Owner though I am sending with the correct address. 

Am not able to figure out what I am doing wrong. Do I need to make a delegate call for executing this function?jules says If an account is already deployed, shouldn't we have an error in the tx instead of doing nothing?Megabyte 🧱🚀 says it returns the account address I guessJayden says If you're getting that error, it means that the caller of executeCall is not the owner of the token which owns the account. Feel free to post a repro and I can take a look :)Megabyte 🧱🚀 says Yess I do understand that.. I was testing on remix till now will create a repo and let you know.Jayden says 4337 requires the factory to not revert if the account is already deployed, which is why it returns the account address without revertingJayden says Sounds good! I'd also check the params that were passed to the account to ensure it's pointed at the token you're expectingMegabyte 🧱🚀 says Coolios🫡Benny Giang says Reminder to all!

Some early working MVPs of displaying assets within a TBA within Opensea

Is the high level thought process that an NFT that has the capacity to act as a wallet can at some point interact (buy,sell, ect.) autonomously?jules says Sharing a small independant lib to work with token bound accounts. Created for myself but probably can be useful to others:

 https://github.com/verynifty/6551.js/

Works with an ethers v6 provider. Interesting parts I didnt saw in the current SDK is computing the address of an account/getting infos of an account from a given addressBenny Giang says Correct! It’s certainly an interesting future once NFTs has a Tokenbound account they can operate fully onchain as agentsBenny Giang says Benny Giang says Welcome @jonteth what are you planning to build during ETHLisbon?jonathan | heavydev.eth says gm! Thinking about doing something with erc6551 + Lensjonathan | heavydev.eth says Saw some good ideas listed above so might grab some inspo from thereJayden says This is awesome!! Adding support for custom implementations and better lib detection to the sdk very soonJack says Do you think the npc future is more likely to happen with ai ownership at the token level rather than wallet level?Jayden says Think it will happen at both levels, but at the token layer it means that means they can be bought and sold, opening up lots of cool possibilities.Jack says I’m rly fascinated by this — let’s chat about it when u get to Lisbon :))0xMitty says this is working group mate, let's delete this shitty thingBenny Giang says Yup deletedLucas | Paris | ⌐◨-◨ POAP.studio says online or you actually in lisbon those dates ?jonathan | heavydev.eth says Will be there irl!

If not out-of-the box, what does it takes to support these, would we just need to add the 4 functions from the TBA interface on top of the exising wallet implementation?Beans says Benny Giang says Welcome beans!Benny Giang says Let us know if you have any feedback. We also have weekly public dev callsBenny Giang says https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1/r?cid=Y185OTNjZmNjOGRjNWE5MDdlM2Y1N2M4YWI0NTQwYzRiMTVhNTQ4ODc2YmQ0OWMyMWEwYmExY2RkMGU2MDE4ZjVhQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20Beans says thanks!

TBAs are compatible with safe / AA wallets / any smart contract account as owners by default. You can hold NFTs in your safe and use their TBAs out of the box. However, smart contract accounts like safe or other 4337 wallets will not work as 6551 implementations out of the box. In order to become compatible, they would need to implement the 6551 account interface and adjust their execution model to be token-based rather than signature based.Nichanan Kesonpat says gotcha ty!Adrian Pang says https://twitter.com/messaricrypto/status/1655583318308429825?s=46&t=2BfwWFohRaKr1_EOF06bpA ❤️Benny Giang says Heads up everyone! TOKENBOUND DEV CALL this week has moved to 8am PST because the team will be in ETHLisbon. If you're around def come by ETHLisbon and say hi or join the hackathon and build on 6551Jack says are you guys organising a proper meetup at Lisbon?Benny Giang says Yup ill send an invite soon

Or currently only works with Sapienz ? Next question. Is it possible to grab a Sapienz on secondary and try it out myself ?jules says Backward compatible with any erc721
