   "text": "Tokenized RWA are easily going to approach a trillion dollar market on top of purely digital assets. Citibank (fwiw) recently called it a “the killer use case” that blockchain needs to drive. \n\nI’ve been thinking more deeply about implications of the 6551 for digital and RWA, and you can apply it seemingly to just about anything that’s ‘complex’ as defined simply by “holds other assets.”  \n\nExamples of complex assets could be: \n\n- A land title NFT with the accompanying paperwork, housing blueprints, history of work on the property etc., \n\n- A car NFT that holds its components like the infotainment system, rims, muffler, etc., \n\n- A sports team (esports team) like the Vancouver Grizzlies (RIP) and its player contracts, merchandising agreements, etc.,  (THIS one I love, I want to build it if anyone else is keen. You can operationalize the entire mechanics of a sports league with smart contracts and tokens, I started some work last year). \n\nOther interesting patterns: \n\n- A “family tree” with seemingly unlimited branches and paths. Can contain family documents, old pictures, records etc., \n\nI’m not sure if the nomenclature of “complex” works here, but I thought it provided an easy way for a new user of the 6551 to understand appropriate use cases broadly. You’ll have to help me to understand if differentiating ‘complex’ from ‘simple’ (meaning shouldn’t hold anything else, like an atomic component of a complex asset) makes sense. In that case a simple asset would be like your classic 721, which although now endowed with the ability to own an account, and other assets, perhaps shouldn’t in some cases?",

Citibank (fwiw) recently called it a “the killer use case” that blockchain needs to drive. \n\nI’ve been thinking more deeply about implications of the 6551 for digital and RWA, and you can apply it seemingly to just about anything that’s ‘complex’ as defined simply by “holds other assets.”  \n\nExamples of complex assets could be: \n\n- A land title NFT with the accompanying paperwork, housing blueprints, history of work on the property etc., \n\n- A car NFT that holds its components like the infotainment system, rims, muffler, etc., \n\n- A sports team (esports team) like the Vancouver Grizzlies (RIP) and its player contracts, merchandising agreements, etc.,  (THIS one I love, I want to build it if anyone else is keen. You can operationalize the entire mechanics of a sports league with smart contracts and tokens, I started some work last year). \n\nOther interesting patterns: \n\n- A “family tree” with seemingly unlimited branches and paths. Can contain family documents, old pictures, records etc., \n\nI’m not sure if the nomenclature of “complex” works here, but I thought it provided an easy way for a new user of the 6551 to understand appropriate use cases broadly.

Since it is not using the Nicks methods, the only way to get that creation address is having the PK from 0x0B36FcE76b3941571a547939B8fbAc2C39F84696. And if the  \"AccountGuardian\" address is not the same, when creating the account implementation (0x1a0e97dae78590b7e967e725a5c848ed034f5510) the code will differ and so the final given address. So we are stuck and can't deploy with the same implementation address.\n\nFor a standard, this shouldn't be done this way, as we won't be able to deploy on not \"officially\" supported, and we will depend on the owner of that account to share the same address multi-chain."
