awliang says Hello and welcome to the <#1131830864888737862> channel <:nfteth:822186186016948314>

Feel free to reach out to the Flashbots Team at any point with your questions!

üëÄ **ABOUT**
Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to stateful blockchains. Our primary focus is to enable a *permissionless*, *transparent*, and *sustainable* ecosystem for MEV, via a three-pronged approach:

- **Illuminate:** bringing transparency to MEV activity.
- **Democratize:** democratizing access to MEV revenue.
- **Distribute:** enabling sustainable distribution of MEV revenue.

We have brought transparency through open MEV activity analytics and dashboard and public and open , with the community, for the ecosystem. We have democratized access to MEV revenue with MEV-Boost that gives all validators access to MEV revenue on equal footing, with the support of a vibrant ecosystem of builders and searchers.

We have started distributing MEV revenue using the MEV-share protocol. This protocol returns 90% of captured MEV to users, wallets, and dapps, who can enjoy its benefits simply by sending transactions with programmable privacy to Flashbots Protect. MEV-share also poses a new challenge for searchers, as they must now learn how to compete for and execute against users' private transactions.


üèÜ **PRIZE OVERVIEW**

üí∞ $2500 - most useful onboarding site for Flashbots Protect with MEV-Share
 üí∏ $1500 -  building the coolest bot searching on MEV-Share
üèÜ $1000 - best design for using MEV-Share and programmable privacy in another application

odysseus0z says Thanks a ton for the help setting up the channel!
epheph says hi
epheph says I'm here to help if anyone has any questions
.cryptowanderer says <@378236262743801867> where can I find you? I have some questions and Shea is mia
epheph says hi! i'm not at ethCC but i can talk
epheph says <@605745673555542026>
.cryptowanderer says ok cool, whats up!
.cryptowanderer says I am playing around with searchers, but prefer to keep that to myself üòÖ
.cryptowanderer says So I'm building you a website
.cryptowanderer says I wonder if you have any thoughts about frameworks you'd prefer? I see that most of your stuff is managed with vercel, so I have gone down the nextjs route, with an automated vercel setup that should work with what you're already using for other site
.cryptowanderer says My main question is: how can I identify which transactions from a given connected account have specifically come from the Protect RPC so that I can display those to users and show them how much Flashbots has saved them... Any leads on how to do such a thing?
.cryptowanderer says <@378236262743801867>
epheph says hey
epheph says so we have an api for this. as an example this transaction came through the flashbots protect: https://etherscan.io/block/17749257
epheph says https://blocks.flashbots.net/v1/blocks?block_number=17749257
epheph says this API lists various tx in each block as `bundle_type":"flashbots` or `bundle_type":"mempool`
epheph says although flashbots could either mean it came from protect OR from eth_sendBundle (like searchers)
.cryptowanderer says yeah, exactly - it sees hard to figure out which one it actually came from just by calling the api. It also seems hard to get the information for a single user account so I can display it when/if they choose to connect a wallet to see what the effect of using the RPC has been. Is there any more detail than this available?

https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-data/blockapi
.cryptowanderer says <@378236262743801867>
epheph says https://blocks.flashbots.net/v1/blocks?from=0x85F420f0dA9535E307814e5d2EDd6a0F57B0EA84
.cryptowanderer says oh, fair, my bad
epheph says but identifying the ones that are bundles vs regular protect transactions are hard
epheph says although, you can remove a lot of bundles because if you look at the response, it'll be bundle_index=2,tx_index=0 + bundle_index=2,tx_index=1
epheph says that means there were 2 tx in that bundle (tx 0 and tx1)
epheph says a protect transaction will never have 2 tx
epheph says a bundle CAN have 1 tx, but a protect tx CANNOT have more than 1
.cryptowanderer says OK, so filtering out all responses with bundle_index > 1 should get me maybe halfway there, but still not perfect i.t.o identifying just the protect txes?
.cryptowanderer says And, is the amount "saved" for the user who has just connected their account `eth_sent_to_fee_recipient - fee_recipient_eth_diff`  for those filtered txes, or have the new names got me confused there?
.cryptowanderer says <@378236262743801867>
epheph says you can filter out all bundles that have a tx_index > 0
epheph says `bundle_index=2,tx_index=0 + bundle_index=2,tx_index=1`
epheph says this will have a tx_index=0 in it, but you know it's not a protect, because it ALSO has a tx_index=1 (and a protect tx is a bundle with only a tx_index=0)
.cryptowanderer says Cool, thanks <@378236262743801867> 

The request is:

    A tool that shows the user the history of the wallet address‚Äô interactions with Flashbots Protect
    Statuses of user's Protected txs
    User's MEV-Share refund total

which is why I ask about how to calculate the refund total... It's not obvious to me which amounts this relates to just by looking at the json returned when querying a given account
.cryptowanderer says <@378236262743801867> you still around at all?
epheph says Hi
epheph says The mev - share data is not yet publicized. It‚Äôs easy to gather on chain , but we don‚Äôt have a easy to use tool
.cryptowanderer says what happens if I have a tx_index of 0, but a bundle_index of like 10? Is that still indicative of a Protect tx, or am I only looking for bundle_index === 0 and tx_index === 0?

I hear you about gathering from the chain, but that adds another layer to the site which I want to be simple and static üòÖ
.cryptowanderer says OK, so say I go ahead and fetch it from the chain <@378236262743801867> ... Please forgive me noobness, but here is my basic strategy:

.edited

slowly figuring this out...
epheph says Sounds like it from what I could read before you edited
.cryptowanderer says Yeah, etherscan doesn't like me much anymore because I was hammering their API until like 3am in the morning üòÖ 

But here it is: https://flashbots-protect-andytudhope.vercel.app/
