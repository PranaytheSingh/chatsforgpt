üëÄ **ABOUT**
**Scroll** is a zero-knowledge rollup built to scale Ethereum. We're committed to Ethereum's ethos, and like to call ourselves the community-first zkEVM.

If you‚Äôre experienced in building on Ethereum, your code, dependencies, and tooling work with Scroll out of the box. This is possible because our network is compatible with EVM bytecode and designed to feel just like developing on Ethereum. With the launch of the Alpha testnet on Goerli, Scroll is inviting the developer community to join early and begin innovating.

We're currently working on using existing Scroll's L1 gateway to bridge ERC-721 tokens, but we've run into a bit of a snag. The gateway contract doesn't seem to have a specific function to bridge ERC-721 tokens. We expected to have something like the `depositERC20` function.

We're wondering if it would be appropriate to use the depositETHAndCall function instead, with the following call sequence:

1) user's tx calls L1-ERC-721-Token.depositToScroll(tokenId). Given TokenId gets burnt on L1
2) ERC-721-Token.depositToScroll(tokenId) calls L1GatewayRouter.depositETHAndCall(_to=L2-ERC-721-Token, _amount=0, _data=rlp(L2-ERC-721-Token.receiveFunction.selector, tokenId))
3) The call gets passed to L2 Scroll and L2-ERC-721-Token.receiveFunction(tokenId) gets executed and tokenId gets minted on L2

If anyone has any insights or suggestions, we would greatly appreciate your input. Thank you!","",""

"2023-03-26,14:31:58","tao8617","#0","Happy to connect here, we are zkDELX team!

## Who we are:
We are a team consisting of members with backgrounds in decentralized renewable energy market research (including Ph.D. theses), mechanical engineering in the energy industry, and senior web3 development experience. Our goal is to leverage blockchain technology to create a trustless and decentralized electricity exchange protocol that can match renewable energy supply with demand.

## What we‚Äôve built for this Hackathon:
`zkDELX` is an innovative decentralized electricity exchange protocol based on zkEVM that facilitates the integration of electric vehicles and renewable energy industries. This protocol provides a user-friendly and efficient experience, similar to popular ride-sharing services like Uber, to match the supply side of green energy generated from households with surplus energy storage, and the demand side of electric vehicles finding charging sources in a very convenient way.

Sellers can create an offer by providing their energy storage information, location, and electricity price, which is aggregated from local real-time electricity prices using a price oracle. Buyers can select the offer based on the options of price, demand for electricity, and distance between the seller's energy storage location and the buyer's electric vehicle.Powered by advanced zkEVM technology scaling solutions, the transaction is low-cost and high-volume.

To further decentralize the platform, the backend database also utilizes a decentralized database to store information. As a result, the transaction data can potentially become a public good product that facilitates research and development within the green industry.

## How does it work:
The project utilizes smart contracts deployed on zkEVM blockchains. It is built upon two major pieces: zkEVM and a complete L2 architecture. Sponsor technologies such as Scroll, Polygon, and Taiko were used to enhance the capabilities of zkEVM.

The backend of the project is decentralized and uses Polybase, a privacy-preserving decentralized database built on zk-STARKs. A zk-rollup combined with native indexing allows decentralized database rules, fast queries, and scalable writes.

The frontend of the project is built using wagmi, a collection of React Hooks that makes it easy to work with EVM. wagmi enables the user to connect a wallet, display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts.

The project also relies on a price oracle that aggregates data from electricity price suppliers such as The U.S. Energy Information Administration and Alberta Electric System Operator.

Overall, the project uses a variety of cutting-edge technologies to provide a decentralized platform for facilitating the integration of electric vehicles and renewable energy industries. By leveraging sponsor technologies and a decentralized database, the project is able to scale and offer fast, efficient, and secure transactions

üî• ** What we‚Äôve built ?** A dApp that uses Chainlink oracle to provide escrow service to financial institutions, to increase the amount of credit they can lend in** fiat local currency **to unbanked people from LatAm, without taking extra risk. The person without credit scoring sets up a warranty in **stablecoin** and the institution grants them a credit card /credit for the same amount or more, according to their business rules. 

üåê  **Where? **We‚Äôve developed this project on EVM-compatible blockchains and love to developed on **Scroll. Would love some feedback üôÇ **

üïØÔ∏è **Why?** This helps the **65% unbanked population of LatAm ** and contributes the overall economic growth of the region. After this first step, people demonstrate the ability to pay in local currency their debts and **start building their credit scoring** that will allow them to access better options in the future. 

üöÄ **What‚Äôs next?** We are working in the unification of different wallets using zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable credentials to create a n**ew decentralized digital identity**, cross-lender, cross-blockchain, and cross-scoring protocols unifying them. 

Check it out:  https://ethglobal.com/showcase/xscrow-j571i

üëÄ **ABOUT**
**Scroll**¬†is a zero-knowledge rollup built to scale Ethereum. We're committed to Ethereum's ethos, and like to call ourselves the community-first zkEVM.If you‚Äôre experienced in building on Ethereum, your code, dependencies, and tooling work with Scroll out of the box. This is possible because our network is compatible with EVM bytecode and designed to feel just like developing on Ethereum. With the launch of the Scroll testnet on Sepolia, Scroll is inviting the developer community to join early and begin innovating.
