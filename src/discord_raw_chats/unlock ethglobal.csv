üëÄ **ABOUT** 
**Unlock** is an open source, Ethereum-based protocol designed to streamline membership benefits for online communities. Unlock is meant to help creators find ways to monetize or manage membership without relying on a middleman. It‚Äôs a protocol ‚Äî and not a centralized platform that controls everything that happens on it.Unlock‚Äôs mission is about taking back subscription and access from the domain of middlemen ‚Äî from a million tiny silos and a handful of gigantic ones ‚Äî and transforming it into a fundamental business model for the web.The Unlock Protocol can be applied to DAO tooling (e.g. token gating) content locking (paywalls), newsletters, software licenses or even the physical world, such as NFT ticketing.

ü•á 1st Prize $3,000

We've since built on that hackathon entry and raised $500k in pre-seed funding, as well as taking part in Animoca-backed accelerator Launchpad Luna. We're very busy working towards MVP launch in the next few months. You can see our entry here: https://showcase.ethglobal.com/hackfs2021/games-vault

We used Unlock extensively for GameVault, so I'm going to be around here during the hackathon to help out as best I can! I also built the Unity and Decentraland integrations for Unlock, so if you have any questions on them, I can help out there too!

Best of luck everyone! üîí üöÄ","",""

üëÄ **ABOUT** 
**Unlock** is a protocol developers, creators, and platforms can use to create memberships. Unlock‚Äôs goal is to ease implementation and increase conversion from ‚Äúusers‚Äù to ‚Äúmembers,‚Äù creating a much healthier monetization environment for the web.

In short, Unlock is an open-source, collectively owned, community-governed, peer-to-peer system that creates time-based memberships.

Unlock Protocol belongs to the Unlock Ecosystem, not Unlock Labs, and is governed by the Unlock DAO.

We aim for Unlock Protocol to be the primitive for every membership, both online and offline, around the globe. Together, we will create an internet owned and monetized by creators and their supporters.


üèÜ **PRIZE OVERVIEW **

**Unlock is awarding prizes to projects that have the most inventive use of Unlock:**
ü•á 1st Prize: $3000
ü•à 2nd Prize: $1500

We're building dapp for creators called Raindrop.

Raindrop offers creators a decentralized alternative to platform subscriptions sites like Patreon or Onlyfans. We help creators access web3 technology to better.

Our goals is to make it easy for creators to issue their own membership NFTs so that they can connect with their fans without middlemen. The bug above is a problem that is occurring when issuing Membership NFTs.

üëÄ **ABOUT** 
**Unlock** is an open source, Ethereum-based protocol designed to streamline membership benefits for online communities. Unlock is meant to help creators find ways to monetize or manage membership without relying on a middleman. It‚Äôs a protocol ‚Äî and not a centralized platform that controls everything that happens on it.Unlock‚Äôs mission is about taking back subscription and access from the domain of middlemen ‚Äî from a million tiny silos and a handful of gigantic ones ‚Äî and transforming it into a fundamental business model for the web.The Unlock Protocol can be applied to DAO tooling (e.g. token gating) content locking (paywalls), newsletters, software licenses or even the physical world, such as NFT ticketing.
