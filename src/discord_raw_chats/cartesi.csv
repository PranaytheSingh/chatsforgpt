👀 **ABOUT** 

The Blockchain OS, is building Cartesi Rollups, a modular execution layer that elevates simple smart contracts to decentralized Linux runtimes. It allows developers to launch highly scalable rollup chains, and code decentralized logic with their favorite languages and software components.

- Every DApp has its own high-performing rollup chain;
- No cannibalization of resources from other DApps in Cartesi's ecosystem;
- No network gentrification;
- Enable an entirely new class of DApps that currently cannot run on EVM chains;
- Preserve the strong security guarantees of the underlying blockchain

Welcome to The Blockchain OS, home to what’s next.

Yesterday I discussed with Gabriel Barros after his amazing presentation the possibility of deploying the Cartesi contracts in some more testnets and build the required docker images so they can be used in ""testnet-prod"" mode. This would be cool as it would allow for better composability with other partners in Eth Global Paris.

Here are my testnet suggestions:
