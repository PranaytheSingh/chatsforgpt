üëÄ **ABOUT** 
**Biconomy** is a Web3 developer platform that empowers blockchain developers to build without limits, so we can all easily access and benefit from a decentralised future.

We power meta-transactions at scale with a non-custodial, multi-chain, and gas efficient relayer infrastructure network.

Since Nov 2022, we‚Äôve launched a powerful and hyper-flexible SDK that lets developers build effortlessly while keeping things simple for end users.

Integration with the SDK takes only minutes, and allows easy plugging, stacking, and customisation of APIs and modules that result in one-click user journeys, transaction bundling, and control over gas fees.
