The only thing that blocks us from building a dApp is having access to a Worldcoin app or action ID because we cannot use their SDK without any app ID which can only be obtained from their Developer Platform. 
We sent an e-mail to the Worldcoin team and tried to reach them on Discord regarding this issue. One of our teammates lives in Germany, and he could download the app, but you are required to scan your retina to get an appID which raises privacy concerns for us.

then, have them connect wallet 2 to your dapp, and have them perform a second World ID verification for the **same action** with the second wallet address as the signal, and once again submit a transaction to verify this proof on-chain and check the message sender against the address in the signal

if the `nullifierHash`es of the proof are identical (which they will be if it's the same World ID user performing the same action), and the message sender matches the signal of each proof, you now know that the same world ID user controls both wallets used

"2023-08-11,22:20:45","andreth207","#0","We are presenting our project C3 Blockchain, to explain how we did it, and how we have used OP Stack and Worldcoin in order to achieve our goal that was to give part of the gas fee to the creator on each transaction within their verified smart contracts. The process is like this diagram, here is the explanation.

1- When the blockchain is running, C3 Node listens to the events from the State Bridge (Worldcoin) Smart Contract in the Goerli testnet and pull the latest state.

2- C3 Node (op-node) updates the C3WorldID (State Bridge on C3) with the State Bridge from Goerli.

3- WorldID Verified User creates a Contract in C3 Blockchain.

4- WorldID Verified User registers the contract in the C3FeeRegistry.

5- C3FeeRegistry checks if WorldID Verified User is verified with Worldcoin in the C3WorldID and returns true in case the verification success. 

6- Standard User makes a transaction in the smart contract.

7- At the moment the transaction is being executed, C3 Node checks if the contract is verified.

8- If contract is verified WorldID Verified User balance is updated with the fee received.

I hope you like our application with worldcoin in this hackathon, we would love to keep building with it!","","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/971226642276057088/1139745260377997373/f4b1c8ab-7668-4074-8b6f-7b78effa1336.png"

During this hackaton we created a platform to help the Optimism Fundation measure impact on projects and know which one to grant for the RetroPGF. And to be able to make the voting mechanism sybil resistant, we enforce users to own a world ID to be able to vote.

**What is Retro Red ?**

This platform serves as a hub for consolidating projects within the optimism ecosystem. Any user has the option to include their project by adhering to a simple data structure in our open-source repository, ensuring its listing on the platform.

For each of these projects, we have diligently collected data using our proprietary indexer, supplementing it with additional information sourced from GitHub and DeFiLlama. This approach ensures a diverse range of impactful insights from various corners of the ecosystem.

Subsequently, we've validated this data on-chain, a step that empowers the optimism foundation in streamlining the RetroPGF process (detailed information available on RetroPGFs), while also granting users the opportunity to explore novel undertakings.

Moreover, users hold the ability to cast their votes in a sybil resistant way with  Worldcoin in favor of projects they prefer, thereby contributing to their overall appraisal.

What we built? üñ•Ô∏è
We created a fee rewarding blockchain modifying the op-geth of OP Stack. Half of the gas from any transaction goes to the contract owner address which is saved in a certain part of the contract storage. We also made worldcoin updates and verifications on the op-node, we modified it to fetch the latest worldcoin state and update our own worldcoin verifier. This pull architecture allows any OP chain to use worldcoin without waiting for them to whitelist their chain. Only whitelisted contracts by verified users can receive fees

Why we built it?ü§î
We are very curious people and we wanted to make something original out of the op-stack. Currently we are aiming to work as infra/core devs and this was an excelent oportunity. On the business side we think that fee rewarding blockchains are perfect for fast grow and solve a critical issue in projects such as Safe, Aragon and Superfluid, not having a concrete source of income. üòé

"2023-08-14,17:40:50","timecoder15","#0","We want to introduce our project, **PerCapita**.
**How PerCapita Works?** Per Capita is a smart contract on the Zora Testnet. Collection owners can launch their Initial NFT Offerings from the PerCapita website. Individuals can join offerings by depositing the required amount and proving they are a human and participating in that offering for the first time. This proof is generated by World App and verified on-chain thanks to the Proof of Personhood technology of Worldcoin. When the deadline is over, the execution of offerings will be incentivized by rewards from the deposit pool so that anyone can execute distribution. Execution requests a random seed for determining who the winners are and it is received from Chainlink VRF. Thanks to Lehmer Random Number Generation algorithm, we can determine winners and which NFT they won only in constant time complexity O(1).  After distribution, individuals can claim their NFTs if they won,. Because Chainlink VRF and Worldcoin contracts do not exist in Zora, we have deployed Hyperlane to Zora, which provides fast cross-chain messaging.
**Why do we use WorldCoin:** PerCapita is an Initial NFT Offerings platform, enables individuals to create their own NFT offerings. As expected, one of the critical aspects for an NFT offering platform is to prevent a single person from participating in the same offering with multiple accounts, as the possibility of disruption by numerous bot accounts exists. Preventing Sybil attacks is very important for fair distributions, which will take on-chain. And thanks to Worldcoin, we can do that without third-party services, KYC or Web2 solutions.
**How we use WorldCoin:** We used Hyperlane to verify personhood proof on Goerli network and send the result back to Zora network. PerCapita sends the proof generated by Worldcoin IDKit widget to Goerli, and validate on World ID Router contract.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/chainabstraction-9k511

Desciption:
multiChain accountAbstraction implementation. One abstractedAccount at its originalChain is able to manipulate its linked otherChain abstractedAccount with operations being done by the address that created the AA or the owner of the nullifierHash that crated the AA with his worldID (even if its not the same EOA address).

exampleUseCase:
We have a user that has linkedAbstractedAccounts in polygon and optimism. He has 70 usdc on polygon aa and 50 in optimism aa. He wants to send 100 usdc to an EOA on optimism, so what he does is he send the 70 he has on his polygon aa to the optimism EOA using multichainInfraestructure and at the same time invoques a transaction (invoques from the polygon aa) on the optimism aa to send the remaining 30 usdc to the EOA.
The end result of the balances of the users abstractedAccounts are:
* PolygonAA; 0
* OptimismAA; 20 And the optimism EOA has received 100 usdc without even knowing that transfer was done through a multiChain process.
The project is been built with solidity, react and ethersJs stack in this multiple blockchains :
- goerliEthereum 
- sepoliaEthereum
- goerliOptimism
- baseTestnet
- zoraTestnet
- modeTestnet

Your question has made me think, maybe a set of generic contracts that DAOs (sets of smart contracts) can use to inherit different types of wordlcoin on-chain verification functionality. For example instead of just basic one action per nullifier hash, (one vote per person), contracts can have configurable amounts of votes/actions, and different types of voting.
