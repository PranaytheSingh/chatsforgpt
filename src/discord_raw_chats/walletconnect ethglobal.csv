If you want to produce a custom QRCode image, you could listen for the `display_uri` event on the provider and then generate one suited to your needs (this is also how the qrcode-modal does this internally via the external `qrcode` pkg).

I put together a quick sandbox with the default provider example + a listener for the `display_uri` event:
https://codesandbox.io/s/musing-raman-86q8qh?file=/src/App.js

Here's how the QRCode modal generates the QRCode SVG internally, which may help as a reference point:

We are working on a hack called BlockFuse. The problems we are solving:

- Web2 recruitment solutions are not user-friendly
- They‚Äôre expensive
- They‚Äôre not suited for web3 candidates
- It‚Äôs hard for candidates to prove skill
- It‚Äôs difficult for recruiters to verify talent. 

BlockFuse revolutionizes the recruitment process in web3 by providing the infrastructure for educators, recruiters, and candidates to mint and aggregate proof-of-skill badges with the rest of your professional identity.

We‚Äôre looking for hiring managers, recruiters, job seekers or anyone who is currently working in web3 to complete a short, 5 minute survey to help us refine our solution. https://forms.gle/NBWzVqRbJoTEtsrL6
