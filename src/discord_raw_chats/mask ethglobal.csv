Feel free to reach out to the Mask Network Team at any point with your questions!

üëÄ **ABOUT**
**Mask Network** brings privacy and benefits from Web3 to social media like Facebook & Twitter - with an open-sourced browser extension.
Next.ID was initiated by the core team responsible for the development of Mask Network last year.

Next ID is an open-source protocol designed for developers to create and manage identities. The Next ID protocol acts as a secure conduit connecting various web2 and web3 identifiers, such as wallets, Twitter profiles, ENS names, Lens profiles, and more.

When a person's different identifiers are linked together, they form an identity graph, creating powerful, portable, and self-sovereign digital identities. We refer to these identities, digital representations of self, as avatars at Next ID.
