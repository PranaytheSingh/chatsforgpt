multi part one to start.
p1. if i remove all liquidity from a uni pool then put it back in a different tick, do i have to move the price to the new spot between the remove liq and add liq functions?
p2 when i move the liq i have amountA, amountB, and a higher tick, how do it (in solidity) calculate the price point within the higher tick so all of tokenA and tokenB are in a concentrated position within that tick
p3 this needs to happen in a zero parameter function, just conditional.... it does collect(fees)-> decreaseLiquidity-> collect(all liquidity) -> mint in higher tick - >

can i control what token is token0 and token1 in the pool? i want to avoid dealing with zeroForOne stuff my liquidty contract is messy enough already

i want to value 1 wbtc at 35000 usdc, how do i know what tick represents that value(or close to it) - if the answer is ""that math is crazy just use the helper function or trial and error on test net"" thats understandable honestly cuz that math is crazy","",""

p2. to clarify, i assume by higher tick you mean higher tick range? positions are defined between tickLower and tickUpper. 

if you want it to be super concentrated, you can just calculate what tick approximates to a sqrtPriceX96 here https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/TickMath.sol, use that as tickLower then increment 1 from that to get the the tickUpper

You need to encode the ratio to sqrtRatioX96 first, the math for this is pretty simple and linked previously here: https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-periphery/blob/main/test/shared/encodePriceSqrt.ts

basically sqrt(reserve1/reserve0) * 2^96

I'm trying to reach protocols which are present in the Dapp's architecture to see what feedback different they will provide.

Bob receives his salary of $10,000 in ETH every month. He believes in ETH, thinks it'll surpass $10,000 by the end of 2021, so every time he has to sell portion of his ETH, he gets sad. Introducing - Super Wallet. Super Wallet is built with Superfluid. Allowing users to manage their income in great detail. So, how can Super Wallet help Bob? Well, all Bob has to do is demand his salary to be paid in ETHx via Superfluid and set up few parameters. In this case, Bob wants to sell 30% of his income every month and HODL the rest. He simply tells Super wallet the following - Take 100% of my salary ($10,000 in ETH) and deposit it to Aave/Compound. Then, borrow $3,000 and send that to my wallet. Now, every time Bob's salary is due, he gets $3,000 (30% of his salary) in ETH (or whichever token he wishes to borrow) and rest is open as a long position on ETH. Few months pass by & ETH has appreciated in price. Bob can repay the debt to Aave/Compound via Super Wallet with his next salary & receive the rest of the ETH in his wallet.
We can expand this functionality to various protocols. Paid in ERC20 tokens? Have Super Wallet swap X% amount of it for another token, like a stablecoin. Want to go long? Deposit your income into a lending protocol & borrow. Want to save X amount of $ from your income aka create a savings account? No problem. Super Wallet can help with that.

Excited to see what will be built & looking forward to feedbacküëç","",""

"2021-10-03,12:30:59","chimeradefi","#0","Hey, I was thinking of writing an ERC20 adapter for Uniswap v3 pools. 

I.e. 
Given an NFT, the adapter contract would mint an ERC20 token for the user. Could be based on `secondsPerLiquidityInsideX128`
**Benefit**: This would allow protocols to continue using their ERC20 based SNX/masterchef rewards geysers while utilising uniswap v3 pools e.g. for rug protection or like-wise e.g. stables, mimicing a stabeswap for cheap. 
As `secondsPerLiquidityInsideX128` increases over time, it would be up to the user to call `mint` on the adapter to accrue more of the ERC20 over time depending on a PnL analysis. 
The adapter would lock up and store the NFT, and return it to the user when the minted ERC20 tokens are returned and burnt. 
Basing most of it on the UniswapV3Staker. 

Is this something that uniswap would find useful? 
Is it UGP worthy? Or is it already a WIP somewhere?

The premise is to use on-chain verifiable tarot cards that are NFTs to represent decisional voting to swap a coin in 1 of 3 different directions. Users would create an Aztec note, so the funds would be private, all you know is the coin type. Then on an IRL card pull, there is a subjective interpretation by a DAO user to swap your token in 1 of 3 ways, each pull per different coin. 

The idea is to incorporate into Gnosis Guild exit module as well, if it is a binary decision on Exit or Not. In the future, might think about optimism as scaling as well for multi-rounds, but not the focus for the hack, and even some type of Circles / UBI 'trust' to other persons in their decision.

To clarify, the swaps wouldn‚Äôt be random, but more creating some subjective decision augmentation about where to map liquidity if we‚Äôre living more in metaverse worlds (gaming), or if there are local token economies in various cities. 

Those that are pulling cards amongst a group of people (lets say 256 card pullers) can be viewed as oracles for where to allocate liquidity (amongst some greater set). 

The single card pulls per decision might sway decision making. If we view the micro ticks of price changes on-chain, can their be macro movements traced through swapping decision making for various web3 travellers.

The other option is to use cards to help dictate price risk in the 3 tiers, maybe for DAO treasury holdings, but I think I want to more focus on users that are engaged in cross DAO activities where pulls or swaps might dictate Exits on decision making.","_connormartin#0",""

"2021-11-04,16:59:09","markcarey","#0","Working on implementing V3 flash swaps but getting revert error `SPL`.  Note that I am calling `swap()` here. Here is the function call, with important values filled in for clarity:
```IUniswapV3Pool(pairAddress).swap(address(this), true, 3999877929687500000, 0, data);```
In case it helps, the addresses for `token0` and `token1` are, respectively: `0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f` (DAI) and `0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2` (WETH) against a forked mainnet chain.
I understand that `SPL` relates to a `Square root price limit` and the docs for the `swap()` function say:  `The Q64.96 sqrt price limit. If zero for one, the price cannot be less than this value after the swap. If one for zero, the price cannot be greater than this value after the swap` But I get this error whether I set this to `0` or `type(uint160).max`","",""

Look at the `approve` function within your ERC20 contract, as if it's from OpenZeppelin you couldn't reset the allowance to something different than 0 if there was already an allowance.

Using the example:
` function swapExactInputSingle(uint256 amountIn)
      public                  //used to be external
      returns (uint256 amountOut)
  {
      safeTransferWithApprove(amountIn, address(swapRouter));
      ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params = ISwapRouter
          .ExactInputSingleParams({
              tokenIn: DAI,
              tokenOut: WETH,
              fee: 3000,
              recipient: msg.sender,

          });
      amountOut = swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);
      swappedAmount = amountOut;
  }`

I created two version with the reverse hard coded (swap dai to weth, and then another function weth to dai)

In the flashloan portions (executeOperation)
I put this in that function:
`
 //swap Dai to usdc
    swapExactInputSingle(amounts[0]);
    //Swap USDC to Dai
    swapExactInputSingleOut(swappedAmount);  // current error
`

The first swap works as intended, when I'm trying to swap back using my reverse function. I get error like Fail with error 'STF' and Fail with AS (when I put a lower amount).   Now quite sure why I'm erroring.   I even put extra funds in the contract for the slippage to pay back the flashloan.    Any ideas would be appreciated","",""

I think it might be useful to liquidity providers, and the metrics tool could be useful to a large range of people  - I believe The Graph only has 5 minute granularity, which is not appropriate for some use cases?

üëÄ **ABOUT**
The **Uniswap** **Foundation** is the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, its mandate is to support the Uniswap protocol‚Äôs decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate.

Uniswap is the most renowned decentralized exchange (DEX) in the world, built on the Ethereum network. The revolutionary platform has transformed the way digital assets are traded, allowing users to swap tokens without the need for intermediaries or centralized exchanges. Uniswap's innovative approach to liquidity provision, driven by its Automated Market Maker (AMM) system, has disrupted the traditional financial landscape and set the standard for other decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.

The launch of Uniswap V3 brought forth even more groundbreaking features, including concentrated liquidity, customizable fee tiers, and optimized capital efficiency. These improvements keep pushing Uniswap's position as the leading DEX and a cornerstone of the rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem. With its massive user base, exceptional trading volume, and cutting-edge technology, Uniswap continues to inspire new ideas and drive the future of decentralized finance.

Despite boasting impressive features like concentrated liquidity and adjustable fee tiers, Uniswap V3 has untapped potential for further enhancements. We invite you to join us in driving these advancements and shaping the future of the Uniswap ecosystem
