        3. Put $3k USDC as collateral to AAVE
        4. Borrow $2k USDC from AAVE
        5. Repay Flashloan with $2k USDC


2. AAVE liquidation protection bot ($3,000 in 1INCH tokens):
    - Track cost of collateral and debt using Chainlink. When PnL reaching user-defined boundaries (stop-loss and take-profit). Can be assembled in single transaction:
      1. Get Flashloan eqaul to debt
      2. Repay user debt
      3. Swap user's collateral to debt using 1inch API
      4. Repay Flashloan

3. Create long and short synths for $1INCH token using UMA Protocol ($1,000 in 1INCH tokens)

We can OPEN both long and short positions and also CLOSE them. We are just a little surprised on not winning the bounty.

Mantis can just open a long position. No Shorting or closing positions. 
On the UI side too,  we feel we were quite better. 
On the gas price too, we were somewhere around 950k. Mantis has a gas price of 1.6 million.

Just wanted to drop a quick intro & overview for 1inch!

üëÄ **About**
**The 1inch Network** unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest and protected operations in the DeFi space.

The initial protocol of the 1inch Network is a DEX aggregator solution that searches deals across multiple liquidity sources, offering users better rates than any individual exchange. This protocol incorporates the Pathfinder algorithm which finds the best paths among different markets over more than 49 liquidity sources on Ethereum and 12 liquidity sources on Binance Smart Chain. In less than two years the 1inch DEX aggregator surpassed $30B in overall volume.

The 1inch Aggregation Protocol facilitates cost-efficient and secure swap transactions across multiple liquidity sources.

The 1inch Liquidity Protocol is a next-generation automated market maker that protects users from front-running attacks and offers attractive opportunities to liquidity providers.

üèÜ **Prize Overview**
**1inch Network will award 5,000 USD in 1INCH:**

**Mesh network using Web RTC for exchange of limit orders of different protocols**

- ***First place:*** 2,500 USD in 1INCH
- ***Runner-up:*** 1,500 USD in 1INCH

**Open track**

- ***One prize for the most innovative project:*** 1,000 USD in 1INCH

Story
Since 2017 actively using multiple wallets to be able to invest in different cryptocurrencies like:¬†
¬†
-Abra-invest and earn an APY in your crypto deposits
-Coinbase wallet-earn interest
-Atomic wallet-staking
-Infinito wallet-deposits
-jaxx wallet- deposits

-1inch- start using it -how much you save from using the exchange aggregator 
¬†
Problem
To be able to track my PnL you have to do it manually in Excel. It‚Äôs completely a hassle and extremely a paint point. Indeed,¬†It's critical to understanding your transaction cost, yield farming, and add transparency.
¬†
¬†
Solution
Build the product through subgraph form graph sponsored is complete more seamlessness.
Emulate the dashboard of Bloomberg PnL which is the best investments platform and add extra features and indicators.
¬†
For instance:
If you already have a smart contract deployed in 1inch, bootstrapping a new subgraph from this contract can be a good way to get started.
The following command creates a subgraph that indexes all events of an existing contract.
¬†
Top Tree features of the PnL tracker:
1-Transaction costs
2-Incorporate yield farming¬†
3-Easily to import and copied for your tax returns.
¬†¬†
Unique Value Proposition
Transparency and a crystal clear understanding of your PnL in crypto investments.
¬†
¬†¬†
Call to action:
Let me know second thoughts, 1inch team.

Looking forward to building the cutting-edge PnL tracker in the blockchain technology space.

üëÄ **ABOUT** 
The **1inch Network** unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest and protected operations in the DeFi space. The initial protocol of the 1inch Network is a DEX aggregator solution that searches deals across multiple liquidity sources, offering users better rates than any individual exchange. This protocol incorporates the Pathfinder algorithm which finds the best paths among different markets over 180 liquidity sources on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimistic Ethereum, Arbitrum and Gnosis Chain. In just over two years the 1inch DEX aggregator has reached 2M users and surpassed $150B in overall trading volume. The 1inch Aggregation Protocol facilitates cost-efficient and secure swap transactions across multiple liquidity sources.

Feel free to reach out to the 1inch Network Team at any point with your questions!

üëÄ **ABOUT**
The **1inch Network** unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest and protected operations in the DeFi space. The initial protocol of the 1inch Network is a DEX aggregator solution that searches deals across multiple liquidity sources, offering users better rates than any individual exchange. This protocol incorporates the Pathfinder algorithm which finds the best paths among different markets over 180 liquidity sources on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimistic Ethereum, Arbitrum and Gnosis Chain. In just over two years the 1inch DEX aggregator has reached 2M users and surpassed $150B in overall trading volume. The 1inch Aggregation Protocol facilitates cost-efficient and secure swap transactions across multiple liquidity sources.

"2023-07-22,10:40:20","neeel.eth","#0","gm! question, I've got 2 api calls where the only difference is the destination token (stETH & rETH) and the calldata the API is giving me back has a different structure. Both have a straight (direct) route ETH -> stETH & ETH -> rETH.

stETH: https://api.1inch.io/v5.2/1/swap?amount=1000000&src=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE&dst=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&from=0x24509E1F87eDD8fC7c00f0738f45bC70aCe8BD4B&slippage=0.5&disableEstimate=true&receiver=0x62450f4067C79EfdBF2ABd5ae6F089d81cd6672d

rETH: https://api.1inch.io/v5.2/1/swap?amount=1000000&src=0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE&dst=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f&from=0x24509E1F87eDD8fC7c00f0738f45bC70aCe8BD4B&slippage=0.5&disableEstimate=true&receiver=0x62450f4067C79EfdBF2ABd5ae6F089d81cd6672d

I'm decoding the calldata before calling the swap on your router contract to know how much to transfer (SwapDescription.amount)

`(,IPool.SwapDescription memory desc) = abi.decode(swapData[i][4:], (address, IPool.SwapDescription));`
swapData[0] = stETH -> succeeds decoding
swapData[1] = rETH -> fails decoding

The rETH one is much shorter. I've tried ETH->DAI and it's also very short. Not sure why it has different structure. Do you know?","",""
