My goal is to create a ERC20 shorting protocol that simplifies the process of shorting any ERC20 tokens. My idea goes like this. When user comes wanting to short a particular amount of crypto currency. The protocol will collateral from them as required by AAVE to borrow that amount of crypto currency. We place the collateral to AAVE take the crypto currency and sell it in UNISWAP. This will effectively create a short position for the user. If the value of the crypto currency goes down and when the user wants to close the short position I will buy back the crypto from UNISWAP at a cheaper price and pay it back to AAVE and get my initial collateral back. Booking the difference as profit. If the price goes up but liquidation threshold is not reached the user can close the position booking a loss. In case it is liquidated the user books full loss corresponding to the LTV of the crypto currency when the loan was taken.","",""

üëÄ **ABOUT**
**Aave Grants DAO** is a community-led grants program, focused on growing a thriving ecosystem of contributors within the Aave Protocol‚Äôs community. Through funding ideas, projects and events that benefit the broader Aave ecosystem. 

The **Aave Protocol** is one of the most widely used decentralized liquidity protocols that allows users to supply and borrow digital assets. With demand for a stablecoin in the Aave ecosystem, the Aave Companies introduced GHO. **GHO** is a decentralized, over-collateralized, asset-backed stablecoin that is native to the Aave Protocol and pegged to the U.S. dollar. 


üèÜ **PRIZE OVERVIEW**

Best projects on GHO and/or Aave:
*   ü•á $3,500 USDC
*   ü•à $2,500 USDC
*   ü•â $1,500 USDC

5Ô∏è‚É£ Plus the 5 best GHO integrations will receive $500 USDC each

Feel free to reach out to the Aave Grants DAO Team at any point with your questions!

üëÄ **ABOUT**
**Aave Grants DAO**¬†is a community-led grants program, focused on growing a thriving ecosystem of contributors within the Aave Protocol‚Äôs community. Through funding ideas, projects and events that benefit the broader Aave ecosystem.¬†

The **Aave Protocol** is one of the most widely used decentralized liquidity protocols that allows users to supply and borrow digital assets. With demand for a stablecoin in the Aave ecosystem, the Aave Companies introduced GHO. **GHO** is a decentralized, over-collateralized, asset-backed stablecoin that is native to the Aave Protocol and pegged to the U.S. dollar.
