It's important for us to make sure that only the owner of the NFT can create an Apple Wallet Pass corresponding to it, so we're signing the request with logged in wallet's private key.

On the screenshot you can see the message that MetaMask displays when we ask for the signature. Is there any way to make the message a bit less alarming?","","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/819516356616781834/940005740649783396/Screenshot_2022-02-06_at_23.01.54.png"

Here a user can create unlimited NFTs just by playing 2048 games and losing at higher scores will give you good NFT cards in your deck. The cards will hold the score at which the player will lose the game, and the score will be used to fight the opponent's NFT card for the same. Whoever wins this duel will get the staking amount and its card will be burned.

Description :- This project is aimed to solve the problem of Loss of Crypto assets and NFTs due to unlikely events like death and Lost Wallet.

Users will be asked to register for Death Wallet Service, where they can add Nominee Addresses and inactivity time frame of users' addresses.

Nominee Address:- where the Crypto assets should go in case of an unlikely event.
Inactivity Timeframe:- Timeframe of inactivity on address selected by user eg. 1 year, 5 years, etc.

In the case of Unlikely events, the user's crypto-assets can be transferred to its Nominee Addresses.

"2022-02-08,10:50:51","hitchhacker","#3006","The random map generation currently available on the market is done off-chain to generate a random map, and then upload the coordinates of the map to the blockchain. Since there is no repeatability, the world generated in this way is not as Web3. Users cannot generate a world like Sandbox by themselves, and the ownership of the world is still in the hands of Sandbox.

Therefore, this project decided to start from this point, on-chain data that can not be tampered with data (such as block data, hash data) will be the seed for the generation of abstract maps. Abstract maps can be further mint into NFT, then derive more ways to play.

**Innovations of this project:**

- A new perspective on blockchains -- verifiable self-growing distributed data sources;
- The practice of abstract NFT: NFT consists only pointers to renderers;
- The practice of cold media NFT:  the on-chain data is responsible for the generation of the 2D matrix map and the users are responsible for telling the ""story of the map"" by recreation of maps;
- The practice of Arweave with traditional Layer1: traditional chains are responsible for the storage of data, and Arweave is responsible for the storage of stateless code (e.g., generation rules) and resources.
- The practice with NFT as character: load character from NFTs on multi-chain as a character in Map!","",""

**Name: Avid
Showcase: **https://showcase.ethglobal.com/lfgrow/metagram-s1i4j

**Description:
TLDR; **A decentralized social media platform with video content sharing and streaming capabilities.

Web2 showed us the power of creators and audiences, yet left the creators to become vassals of the platform susceptible to every slight change of algorithm; not surprisingly it turned audiences into products exploiting their time and attention for a promise of free content.

We want to offer the users and creators a truly democratic social platform with the same feel and experience as any existing web2 solution. Avid provides users and creators the comfort of web2 but empowers the creators to actively build relationships and be able to completely own and monetize their work. It empowers the audience to invest and grow with the creators they believe in. By doing that, they tear down the barriers of entry to the industry and promote early spotting of valuable content.

Avid is set to revolutionize the creator economy and to serve as the gateway to a new decentralized ecosystem, allowing individuals and brands to go beyond the platform-centric marketing world of Web2, create a new class of assets and reclaim ownership of their digital presence.","",""

It would give small ETH incentives (possibly on Polygon) to find errors in the OCR texts of scanned pages in Archive.org texts or other scanned online texts (users would receive training on how to do this, although many errors are not that hard to understand). It could use IPFS and Filecoin to store the individual page images of scans, and Ceramic possibly to store the OCR data from each individual page. If a proper correction was validated by one or two trusted users, the user would get a reward on Polygon. I believe that this would potentially solve a huge collective action problem that would benefit the data input for artificial intelligence and would benefit all readers and researchers in the world.

"2023-03-16,18:31:44","tonyolendo","#0","Polygon ID is a protocol, it's not an Issuer, Verifier or Holder. Polygon ID is structured around the triangle of trust that is, there's an Issuer, Holder and Verifier.

Issuer: Issues credentials that state a truth. For instance, the Department of Motor Vehicles issues Alice a driving license stating her date of birth as a verifiable credential (VC).

Holder: This is Alice. She gets a VC stating that she can drive and and that her DOB is x date.

Verifier: This can be the liquor store, the liquor store verifies  the VC that Alice presents and confirms that she is indeed above 21. The Verifier doesn't need to know Alice's DOB, just if she's over 21.

As you can see in this description, Polygon is not an Issuer, Verifier or Holder. For your use-case, you need a KYC Issuer to issue a verifiable credentials with certain attestations. you can mock that but in production, you'd implement an Issuer Node for the DMV that issues licenses. Citizens would be holders and institutions/businesses would be verifiers. I hope this clarifies things.","kcpele#0",""

**Name**: üê∞ TBS

**Description**: TBS is a high-performance blockchain scaling platform that achieves scalability through sharding technology, while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.

**How does it work**:
TBS currently employs Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, and Polybase as its layer 1 blockchains. It deploys corresponding smart contracts on these chains to create time beacons and verify the generation of blocks on sharding chains (including shard ID, hash, time, and creator). TBS sharding nodes implement the TBS protocol using a fork of Ethereum-js, and compose a TBS network via libp2p. They use NTP for epoch synchronization and slot allocation in block generation.

The TBS testbed is both a visualization and a development tool for the TBS blockchain. This decentralized JavaScript application runs in the browser, is distributed via IPFS, and is connected via libp2p. It utilizes ECharts for visualizing TBS networks and benchmarking. A GitHub workflow automatically publishes the main version to IPFS.

"2023-03-26,14:32:31","tao8617","#0","Happy to connect here, we are zkDELX team!

## Who we are:
We are a team consisting of members with backgrounds in decentralized renewable energy market research (including Ph.D. theses), mechanical engineering in the energy industry, and senior web3 development experience. Our goal is to leverage blockchain technology to create a trustless and decentralized electricity exchange protocol that can match renewable energy supply with demand.

## What we‚Äôve built for this Hackathon:
`zkDELX` is an innovative decentralized electricity exchange protocol based on zkEVM that facilitates the integration of electric vehicles and renewable energy industries. This protocol provides a user-friendly and efficient experience, similar to popular ride-sharing services like Uber, to match the supply side of green energy generated from households with surplus energy storage, and the demand side of electric vehicles finding charging sources in a very convenient way.

Sellers can create an offer by providing their energy storage information, location, and electricity price, which is aggregated from local real-time electricity prices using a price oracle. Buyers can select the offer based on the options of price, demand for electricity, and distance between the seller's energy storage location and the buyer's electric vehicle.Powered by advanced zkEVM technology scaling solutions, the transaction is low-cost and high-volume.

To further decentralize the platform, the backend database also utilizes a decentralized database to store information. As a result, the transaction data can potentially become a public good product that facilitates research and development within the green industry.

## How does it work:
The project utilizes smart contracts deployed on zkEVM blockchains. It is built upon two major pieces: zkEVM and a complete L2 architecture. Sponsor technologies such as Polygon, Scroll and Taiko were used to enhance the capabilities of zkEVM.

The backend of the project is decentralized and uses Polybase, a privacy-preserving decentralized database built on zk-STARKs. A zk-rollup combined with native indexing allows decentralized database rules, fast queries, and scalable writes.

The frontend of the project is built using wagmi, a collection of React Hooks that makes it easy to work with EVM. wagmi enables the user to connect a wallet, display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts.

The project also relies on a price oracle that aggregates data from electricity price suppliers such as The U.S. Energy Information Administration and Alberta Electric System Operator.

Overall, the project uses a variety of cutting-edge technologies to provide a decentralized platform for facilitating the integration of electric vehicles and renewable energy industries. By leveraging sponsor technologies and a decentralized database, the project is able to scale and offer fast, efficient, and secure transactions

üî• ** What we‚Äôve built ?** A dApp that uses Chainlink oracle to provide escrow service to financial institutions, to increase the amount of credit they can lend in** fiat local currency **to unbanked people from LatAm, without taking extra risk. The person without credit scoring sets up a warranty in **stablecoin** and the institution grants them a credit card /credit for the same amount or more, according to their business rules. 

üåê  **Where? **We‚Äôve developed this project on EVM-compatible blockchains and love to developed on **Polygon blockchain. Would love some feedback üôÇ **

üïØÔ∏è **Why?** This helps the **65% unbanked population of LatAm ** and contributes the overall economic growth of the region. After this first step, people demonstrate the ability to pay in local currency their debts and **start building their credit scoring** that will allow them to access better options in the future. 

üöÄ **What‚Äôs next?** We are working in the unification of different wallets using zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable credentials to create a n**ew decentralized digital identity**, cross-lender, cross-blockchain, and cross-scoring protocols unifying them.
