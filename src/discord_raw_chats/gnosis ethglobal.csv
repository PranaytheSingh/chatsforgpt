As a suggested method, zk-SNARK should be used to enable efficient proof generation through zero-knowledge proof. Some games in our ecosystem also used zkSNARK, e.g., Darkforest, Mithraeum, etc.

Reference: 
1. The core idea here is to use a zk-SNARK (Groth16) to produce a validity proof (which is constant size) and can be efficiently verified on-chain on Gnosis. https://www.ingonyama.com/blogs/bridging-the-multichain-universe-with-zero-knowledge-proofs
2. Gnosis has provided a $600k grant to 0xParc to fund R&D into a zkSNARK-enabled light client, a necessary part of a trust-minimized bridge (see GIP-57 proposal). https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/roadmap/#proof-of-deposit-validity-proofs","0xbaz#0",""

**Name**: 🐰 TBS

**Description**: TBS is a high-performance blockchain scaling platform that achieves scalability through sharding technology, while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.

**How does it work**:
TBS currently employs Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, and Polybase as its layer 1 blockchains. It deploys corresponding smart contracts on these chains to create time beacons and verify the generation of blocks on sharding chains (including shard ID, hash, time, and creator). TBS sharding nodes implement the TBS protocol using a fork of Ethereum-js, and compose a TBS network via libp2p. They use NTP for epoch synchronization and slot allocation in block generation.

The TBS testbed is both a visualization and a development tool for the TBS blockchain. This decentralized JavaScript application runs in the browser, is distributed via IPFS, and is connected via libp2p. It utilizes ECharts for visualizing TBS networks and benchmarking. A GitHub workflow automatically publishes the main version to IPFS.

🔥 ** What we’ve built ?** A dApp that uses Chainlink oracle to provide escrow service to financial institutions, to increase the amount of credit they can lend in** fiat local currency **to unbanked people from LatAm, without taking extra risk. The person without credit scoring sets up a warranty in **stablecoin** and the institution grants them a credit card /credit for the same amount or more, according to their business rules. 

🌐  **Where? **We’ve developed this project on EVM-compatible blockchains and love to developed on **Gnosis chain blockchain. Would love some feedback 🙂 **

🕯️ **Why?** This helps the **65% unbanked population of LatAm ** and contributes the overall economic growth of the region. After this first step, people demonstrate the ability to pay in local currency their debts and **start building their credit scoring** that will allow them to access better options in the future. 

🚀 **What’s next?** We are working in the unification of different wallets using zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable credentials to create a n**ew decentralized digital identity**, cross-lender, cross-blockchain, and cross-scoring protocols unifying them. 

Check it out:  https://ethglobal.com/showcase/xscrow-j571i
