üëÄ **ABOUT** 
**Filecoin**, the world‚Äôs largest decentralized network offering more than 16+ Exbibytes of storage. It allows users to store, request, and transfer data via a verifiable marketplace. Filecoin is completely open-source, enabling people from all over the world to participate.

The **FVM** turns the Filecoin blockchain into a programmable platform that developers can deploy programs to (actors/smart contracts).

The **FEVM** creates a runtime within the FVM which simulates the Ethereum Virtual Machine, making all smart contracts which compile to EVM bytecode, such as Solidity contracts, executable on the Filecoin blockchain.

which has a marketplace where people can sell data as a commodity in a totally decentralized way. 

1) A seller makes a proposal to the DAO via form providing the price/access, METADATA, Sample DATA and other details.

2) To get listed on the marketplace the listing has to go through an approval process which includes voting by DAO members via DAO tokens and other hard coded checks.

3) A client who wants to purchase DATA can buy the DATA through DAO tokens and the revenue earned through the sale is splits between the seller and DAO.

The question is:
With lighthouse the user cannot do this, there is no access control provision that the user pays X amount of Y tokens to Z smart contract which then gives the client access to that encrypted data.
What can be done to make my project work like this?

One solution i can think of is that the user uploads data to our website then make a smart contract which on approval can automatically give access to an address meeting whatever condition like purchasing this data with some tokens without the seller being have to do this process manually by adding private accesses.

Please guide me on what the idea sounds like in general, how can i make it happen if at all it is possible as of now?

üëÄ **ABOUT**
**Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)** is a runtime environment for smart contracts (also called actors) on the Filecoin network. FVM brings user programmability to Filecoin, unleashing the enormous potential of an open data economy.

FVM unlocks boundless possibilities, ranging from dataDAOs, to perpetual storage, to financial services for miners (e.g. collateral lending, liquid staking, insurance protocols), to decentralized compute and Layer 2 networks (such as reputation systems, and incentive-aligned content delivery networks, and more.


üèÜ **PRIZE OVERVIEW**

ü™Ñ **DataDAOs:** Best use and development of data organizations on FVM to incentivize storage of datasets on the Filecoin network - Prize: 1 x $2,000

üöÄ **Programmable Storage markets:** Best use of FVM to orchestrate, aggregate and broker storage on the Filecoin network - Prize: 1 x $2,000

üß∞ **Tooling**: Best use of FVM to build tools to support Filecoin economy participants (e.g., storage providers, storage clients etc.) - Prize: 1 x $2,000

üîó **Primitives & Infra**: Best use of FVM to facilitate intra and inter-protocol transactions - Prize: 1 x $2,000

üÉè **Wild Card**: Awarded to projects with the best overall use of Filecoin's Virtual Machine - Prize: 1 x $2,000

üëÄ **ABOUT**
**Filecoin**, the world‚Äôs largest decentralized network offers more than 16+ Exbibytes of storage. It allows users to store, request, and transfer data via a verifiable marketplace. Filecoin is completely open-source, enabling people from all over the world to participate.

**Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)** is a runtime environment for smart contracts (also called actors) on the Filecoin network. FVM brings user programmability to Filecoin, unleashing the enormous potential of an open data economy.

**FVM**unlocks boundless possibilities, ranging from dataDAOs, to perpetual storage, to financial services for miners (e.g. collateral lending, liquid staking, insurance protocols), to decentralized compute and Layer 2 networks (such as reputation systems, and incentive-aligned content delivery networks, and more.

It is the best option for applications to store their data on Filecoin and IPFS, for instance, decentralised social media, video platform, etc. In this case, applications do not need to handle the storage deal making process, do not care about the verifiability of deals, etc. 
If you are building something like DataDao, perpetual storage, Filecoin storage repair or insurance platform which is highly depends on the storage deals, their status and verifiability. You will need to issue a deal request from my own client contracts, keep track of those deals and take actions according to your project scope.

Hello everyone! üòÑ‚ú®
I'm thrilled to share our amazing project with you all: Dapp Classroom! üìöüî•

With Dapp Classroom, creating and joining classrooms has become quite simple! üè´üíª
Teachers can effortlessly share their unique join codes, allowing students to seamlessly become part of the learning experience. üìùüîó

Assignments are made simple and engaging! üìëüí°
Teachers can upload various documents, links, and even text as assignments, setting deadlines to keep everyone on track. üóì‚è∞
Students, in turn, can submit their work within the given timeframe, showcasing their dedication and creativity. üéíüìù

Here's where it gets exciting! üéâüíØ
Teachers will be able to review the submissions and award grades. üìãüèÜ
But wait, there's more! Grades will be represented as erc-20 tokens, adding a touch of cryptocurrency magic to the mix! üí∞üí´
For instance, scoring 100 grades translates to receiving 100 erc-20 tokens! üíØüí∏

Moreover, Dapp Classroom encourages active communication! üì¢üí¨
As soon as a classroom is created, a vibrant Push Group Chat is automatically established. üì≤üí¨
Everyone can chat together in the main stream of the group chat, fostering collaboration and camaraderie. üë•üí¨

But that's not all! We're taking things up a notch with Huddle 01 for Classroom meetings! üì∫üåê
This exciting feature will revolutionize the way classes are conducted, providing a seamless and immersive experience. üé•üíª

I kindly request your valuable feedback and suggestions on how we can make Dapp Classroom even better! üôè‚ú®","",""
