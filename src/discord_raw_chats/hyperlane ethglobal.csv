"2022-09-14,12:08:59","flyguy352","#0","Will appreciate some help. I deployed the HelloWorld.sol (https://github.com/abacus-network/abacus-app-template/blob/main/contracts/HelloWorld.sol) contracts on both Polygon Mumbai and BSC Testnet. I based the AbacusConnectionManager and InterchainGasPaymaster contract addresses on the documentation.

Next I called the Router's enrollRemoteRouter method to enable communication between my two contracts - on both contracts. Using the addressToBytes32 method of the typecast library I cast the address into the bytes32 type expected by the method.

Next I called the sendHelloWorld function on both contracts, but the 'received' variable value never increments, although the 'sent' variable value does. Did I do something wrong?

Ok on the bright side I tried the simpler stuff with Outbox/Inbox and it seems to be working nicely for me 😄. Just one thing is I noticed a couple of minutes' delay between the time I get the Metamask transaction confirmed prompt vs when the 'received' variable value actually increments in the receiving contract. Hopefully that's normal and I didn't screw something up.","",""

"2022-09-18,07:51:59","flyguy352","#0","Hey sorry for getting back so late, I decided the simple inbox/outbox was good enough for me.

Regarding that I faced a strange/interesting issue, which is I could send data from BSC Testnet to Mumbai but not the other way around. I'm wondering is it maybe to do with how I'm handling the domain identifier in ethers.js? My code looks something like this:

const domainId = 80001;
const targetContractAddress = '0x...';
const someRandomData = '....';
const contract = await ethers.getContract('MyContract');
contract.send(domainId, targetContractAddress, someRandomData);

The contract's send method is really simple, it does some simple stuff before forwarding the data on the the Outbox's dispatch method. It all works fine but when domainId is instead assigned to the documented BSC value of 0x62732d74 (needless to say I also change the targetContractAddress accordingly), the transaction goes through but I never ever receive the message on the destination contract.

Do you have any thoughts on maybe how I could be handling the BSC domain identifier number value starting with '0x' wrongly in ethers.js? Thanks!","yorhodes#0",""

"2022-10-04,10:40:44","jkol","#0","Guys, here's some more info about our prizes! 

- 🥇Top prize - 4k 'Best use of Hyperlane' interchain API
    - To win this prize you simply need to build an application that utilizes Hyperlane's API to establish interchain connectivity. You could be passing messages or assets. You could be making cross-chain view calls or oraclize data between blockchains. There is really no end to what you could build, but given that time is of the essence you don’t want to expand scope too much.
    - A great way to shoot for the top prize is to attempt to make an interchain version of a popular app, i.e. an interchain Compound  or Sudoswap.
- 💸 2k - Best use of Hyperlane - DeFi related
    - As noted above there are many ways you can win our prizes, but here are some DeFi related ideas:
        - You could use our Interchain Accounts API to create an app that allows for interchain swaps without having to deploy any contracts on remote chains.
        - You could create an interchain Stableswap, accepting deposits of assets on multiple chains and creating unified liquidity pools.
        - You could create a contract that allows you to control multiple SAFEs or DAOs on remote chains. Using Interchain Accounts you could do this without having to deploy any additional logic on the receiving chains.
        - You could create interchain payment streaming contracts, collecting deposits on a number of chains and directing assets to their destinations.
- 🌠 2k - Best use of Hyperlane - NFT related
    - You could create an interchain minting contract that acts as a load balancer between chains, i.e collecting orders on several chains (with lower fees or higher throughput) and executing the mint on a different chain.
    - You could create an interchain nft collection where the NFTs have different properties based on the chain they’re currently on.
- 🏗 2k - Best use of Hyperlane - Infrastructure
    - With respect to infrastructure, here’s a chance to build infrastructure either for Hyperlane or build infrastructure for other protocols that uses Hyperlane.
    - For example, a previous Hyperlane prize winner built infrastructure that supports Hyperlane relayers","",""

    - A great way to shoot for the top prize is to attempt to make an interchain version of a popular app, i.e. an interchain Compound or Sudoswap.
    - Another application we would love to see if a Blockchain Smart Router. Imagine being able to route computation to the cheapest blockchain within the Hyperlane network, and then being able to retrieve or read that state whenever necessary from your home chain. Effectively turning any blockchain into your layer 2 and beyond. This will be incredibly challenging to build, but the rewards will be far greater than you can imagine!
- 💸 2k - Best use of Hyperlane - DeFi related
    - As noted above there are many ways you can win our prizes, but here are some DeFi related ideas:
        - You could use our Accounts API to create an app that allows for interchain swaps without having to deploy any contracts on remote chains.
        - You could create an interchain Stableswap, accepting deposits of assets on multiple chains and creating unified liquidity pools.
        - You could create an interchain lending app, allowing borrowers to borrow against collateral from a remote chain.
        - You could create a contract that allows you to control multiple SAFEs or DAOs on remote chains. Using Interchain Accounts you could do this without having to deploy any additional logic on the receiving chains.
        - You could create interchain payment streaming contracts, collecting deposits on a number of chains and directing assets to their destinations.

    - You could create an interchain minting contract that acts as a load balancer between chains, i.e collecting orders on several chains (with lower fees or higher throughput) and executing the mint on a different chain.
    - You could create an interchain nft collection where the NFTs have different properties based on the chain they’re currently on.
- 🏗 2k - Best use of Hyperlane - Infrastructure, Governance, or Gaming
    - With respect to infrastructure, here’s a chance to build infrastructure either for Hyperlane or build infrastructure for other protocols that uses Hyperlane.
    - More specific applications and examples include:
        - SAFE based app would be one that allows you to create a SAFE on one chain, and use any app on any Hyperlane supported chain from that SAFE.
        - An EIP 5164 implementation
        - A Tally or other Governance related integration
        - Lastly, an example we'd love to see built would be a modification with Hyperlane mailboxes or agents (relayer and validator) binaries to make them compatible with non-EVM environments such as Cosmos, Fuel, and others.
    - On the gaming front, either a game, or gaming related infrastructure would qualify.","",""

we've got mantle testnet -> goerli just about live

Alexey, not sure personally yet.

<@539018098905317381>, you've got zkEVM -> where piped? Or are you still on origin setup?

1 more guy in the discord has chiado -> optimism Goerli piped with an error on the last step.

I'm thinkin' it would be real cool for all of us to share infra contracts/knowledgepool, so we know where we're all connecting to core with synthetics/can build on top of each other's stuff in this last push here.

Of course, if we are pressed for time (I am still finishing the backend), as a last resort, we will refuse to use zkevm. But I don't lose hope 🙂","2pats#0、zhanganiev#0、yikesawjeez#0",""

What are you warping between, Dmitry? my conceptualizations are a little fuzzy but I'm feeling like getting us all interop with each other as long as we have some accessible Hyperlane core chain to connect to is just a matter of all of us completing our individual setups and knowing the addresses. After that the warp routes are just a matter of the hyper contracts. please do correct me if I'm wrong tho, actual-devs 😂 lol

edit: im realizing that since the interop does rely on the core hub, do we still have messaging interop between each other? like can I bounce a message down from mantle to goerli to optimism up to scroll if we all finish our projects, or do i need to have an origin-remote between mantle and scroll for that?

Thanks to the hyperlane team for constant support!

RollOP is an Orderbook based Perpetuals DEX on a custom rollup based on the OP-Stack. You can start trading from Optimism, Base / Goerli. Using Hyperlane’s Messaging, we are able to create a unified pools and the warp routes allow a user to use the our synthetic token on Base/Goerli which is equivalent to a USDC and can easily be swaped on Base/Goerli.

The rollup doesn't have access to oracles, so we built our own pricefeeds for the Orderbook. These are used to update the funding rates for our DEX.

We have added the ISM Multisig and IGP contracts as pre deploys to in addition to the existing predeploys on op-stack-hyperlane repo and added scripts to deploy these on other L2s.
Would love to include these changes to the op-stack-hyperlane repo!","",""

**Name**: 🎮 super/Place
**Description**: We are fans of the game r/place on reddit which have a large and united community. I want blockchain users like that too. That's the inspiration for us to create **super/place**
The game logic is quite similar to r/place, which is a game with rounds, each round is 3 minutes. In those 3 minutes, each player can only place a single canvas cell. The interesting point is that we use worldID to verify the user is unique. The main contract is deployed in op-goerli but we support users from other chains like goerli, base, zora by using message API from hyperlane. also we have migrate nft from canvas that allows players to create their own nft at a time and sell it by using the zora createDrop contract.
**Demo**: We currently don't maintain hyperlane validator and replicar so it will only be playable from goerli and op-goerli. but can mint NFT on goerli, base goerli, op goerli and zora goerli

"2023-08-14,17:32:40","timecoder15","#0","We want to introduce our project, **PerCapita**.
**How PerCapita Works:** Per Capita is a smart contract on the Zora Testnet. Collection owners can launch their Initial NFT Offerings from the PerCapita website. Individuals can join offerings by depositing the required amount and proving they are a human and participating in that offering for the first time. This proof is generated by WorldID app and verified on-chain thanks to the Proof of Personhood technology of Worldcoin. When the deadline is over, the execution of offerings will be incentivized by rewards from the deposit pool so that anyone can execute distribution. Execution requests a random seed for determining who the winners are and it is received from Chainlink VRF. Thanks to Lehmer Random Number Generation algorithm, we can determine winners and which NFT they won only in constant time complexity O(1).  After distribution, individuals can claim their NFTs if they won, or they can claim their deposits if they are not winners. Because Chainlink VRF and Worldcoin contracts do not exist in Zora, we have deployed Hyperlane to Zora and used Messaging API of Hyperlane, which provides fast cross-chain messaging.
**Why do we use Hyperlane:** PerCapita is an Initial NFT Offering platform on Zora Testnet. While developing this project, we needed Chainlink VRF and WorldID. However, since these technologies were not active on the Zora network, we decided to utilize Hyperlane technology for cross-chain messaging. We have deployed Hyperlane on Zora and set up our validator and relayers, which are running now 24/7 on a dedicated server. You can find our Hyperlane deployment addresses in our GitHub repository.
**How we use Hyperlane:** We have used Hyperlane's Messaging API to receive Chainlink VRF random seed and Worldcoin personhood proof result from the Goerli network.

"2023-08-14,19:34:03",".knpz","#0","Hey hyperlaneTeam, I used your crossChainInfraestructure to build my project “chainAbstraction”; basic accountAbstractionImplementation thats able to link a users abstractedAccounts between multiple chains.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/chainabstraction-9k511

Desciption:
multiChain accountAbstraction implementation. One abstractedAccount at its originalChain is able to manipulate its linked otherChain abstractedAccount with operations being done by the address that created the AA or the owner of the nullifierHash that crated the AA with his worldID (even if its not the same EOA address).

exampleUseCase:
We have a user that has linkedAbstractedAccounts in polygon and optimism. He has 70 usdc on polygon aa and 50 in optimism aa. He wants to send 100 usdc to an EOA on optimism, so what he does is he send the 70 he has on his polygon aa to the optimism EOA using multichainInfraestructure and at the same time invoques a transaction (invoques from the polygon aa) on the optimism aa to send the remaining 30 usdc to the EOA.
The end result of the balances of the users abstractedAccounts are:
* PolygonAA; 0
* OptimismAA; 20 And the optimism EOA has received 100 usdc without even knowing that transfer was done through a multiChain process.
The project is been built with solidity, react and ethersJs stack in this multiple blockchains :
- goerliEthereum 
- sepoliaEthereum
- goerliOptimism
- baseTestnet
- zoraTestnet
- modeTestnet 
thanks to chainlinkCcip and layerZero multiChain infraestructure. Tools being used are metamaskWallet, hardhat for test development and remix for quick smartContracts design.

Name

Pontis - An NFT bridge based on the implementation of a hyperlane EIP5164 adapter. It is an NFT bridge utilizing the EIP5164 using hyperlane as the transport layer, so it enforces the ERC5164 interfaces, and messages can be called on remote chains using dispatch on the source chain.

How it works

The sender NFT contract inherits from hyperlaneSenderAdapter which implements the MessageDispatch interface and the adapter also inherits all the interfaces from hyperlane necessary for cross chain message passing. The receiver NFT contract inherits from hyperlaneReceiverAdapter which implements the MessageExecutor interface and the adapter inherits all the interfaces from hyperlane necessary for cross chain message passing as well. When someone wants to mint an NFT on the remote chain, the user can call ""mintRemote"" passing a string ""uri"" to be used to mint the NFT on the destination chain, and this function makes a cross chain call by calling dispatch on the hyperlaneSenderAdapter which encodes a function ""mintLocal"" to be called on remote chain, now this message is going to be transported by the hyperlane bridge, and it will be received by the hyperlaneReceiverAdapter, which then decodes the message and executes ""mintLocal"" on the destination chain, thereby minting the NFT on the remote chain. This is just an example use case of the hyperlane EIP 5164 adapter in action using an NFT bridge as the usecase.
