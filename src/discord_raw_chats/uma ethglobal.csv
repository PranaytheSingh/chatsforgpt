"2021-01-31,14:23:29","somebody","#2131","Yes, we're concerned about making a synthetic that is extremely volatile. 

If there is no incentive to increase collateral and the starting collateralization ratio is too low, wouldn't the probability of the synthetic breaking be quite high? I.E. at expiration of the synthetic token there would be no way to redeem it for its full value. This would be a bad experience for the buyers.

One way to fix this would be to require a very high initial collateralization ratio but we're afraid that would be a bad experience for the sellers. Would people really be interested in minting a volatile synth if the ratio was 3X or 5X?

We're not sure how to reconcile this for the buyers and sellers (seller = someone who mints, not who buys and sells on a secondary market). 

One thought was to have a way to incentivize adding collateral to avoid liquidation. 

Do you have any examples of users or people on your team calculating the trade-off of allowing their collateral to be liquidated vs. hypothetical losses incurred for different ranges of price movements (e.g. 100%, 200%, 300%)??","chandlerdk#0",""

Option A) Have a few premade contracts that track prices of major Ethereum tokens/indexes like Ether, Chainlink, Uniswap Token, etc. The user can still set parameters such as strike and expiry when opening a CFD.

Option B) Have a system in which users create their own contracts on-demand from scratch and enter their own token addresses. This would allow anyone to trade CFDs for ANY Ethereum security token.

With Option A, each contract would be individually collateralized, totally separate of one another (easier to integrate with UMA and more accessible to retail investors but with less customization).

With Option B, there would be one pool of collateral proportionally collateralizing each token based on how many active CFDs are tracking its price (endless options for users, but with higher gas fees and tricky business logic).

"2021-02-03,11:47:01","jdshutt","#0","Basically, your incentive is that your collateral becomes liquidatable while it is still more valuable than the synthetic. Let's say the cutoff point is 1.25 collateralization. You become liquidatable when your collateral reaches 1.24, so the liquidator has an incentive to pay back your debt (in the synthetic) and take all of your collateral, and you're incentivized to top it off.

If the price crashes fast enough that you're actually *undercapitalized*, below 1.00, then there's no incentive to liquidate a position or to top off collateral. For extremely volatile collateral, the safe collateralization ratio would be higher than for less volatile collateral, and can be set in the contract configuration.","somebody#2131",""

Looking at the docs here:
https://docs.umaproject.org/synthetic-tokens/long-short-pair#lsp-example

Why would Bob in this story deploy the contract and call expire (utilizing gas!) when he had no part in establishing a position? Is this an oversight and it should have been Alice or am I missing something?","",""
"2021-06-18,02:51:08",".christn","#0","Hey UMAns,

In our team we are pretty sure we want to build a UI for the new LSP contracts.

We are still thinking about the right configuration that provides an attractive use case.
One idea we are currently considering is using the Linear Payout function combined with Foreign Exchange Price Feeds and (potentially interest yielding) USD Stable Coin collateral to enable users to hedge against currency risk with respect to their home (non-USD) currency.

The users would be able to mint / redeem the tokens through our DApp and could then trade the long / short tokens on the secondary market. (Maybe we could integrate Uniswap etc. to allow the user to trade these tokens through the same UI).

What do you think about that idea ? 
Do you think it is an attractive use case ?
Are there projects building something similar already that you are aware of ?
Do you see any technical pitfalls / challenges with this contract setup ?

One aspect we aren't quite sure about yet is, what the incentive would be for ""liquidity providers"" that mint the tokens in the first place and put them up on uniswap to get the secondary market started. (beyond potential Uniswap fees).","",""

On the surface of it, your idea is very cool! And one I am interested to unpack with you.

I'm not fully aware of another project doing this specific idea so you have the first stab at it (although this is just my optics) 

We'd need to unpack the idea a bit more to figure out pitfalls - but on the surface it all seems possible. 

So the benefit of the LP is to either mint both side of the trade and LP with that, or take one side of the trade and sell the other side to an LP pool - there are a few challenges with LPing the LSP since it is not as straight forward as traditional LP pools. I also see an interesting case for an LP to use these tokens as a far easier hedge.",".christn#0",""

Where I am still pretty much in the dark is what will need to be done to implement / host  the disputer / proposer bots that I understand are needed to secure the contracts.

In the ethVIX case, the development team provides the VIX values via an API, but with a fallback to calculating with raw data. In your case, since the raw data comes from on-chain, you may not need to make a centralized API available, except for your own convenience.

Use the OO to build a zero-slippage gas-less optimistic decentralized exchange, in which assets can be swapped within a smart contract based on orders posted publicly by users, but bundled and executed on-chain by relayers.

**IDEA 2**
Protocol owned liquidity has become the next big area for DeFi to try and solve. Come up with your own POL service that uses UMA‚Äôs financial contracts. You can use the standard Success Token or create your own payout ‚ÄùOlympus Pro‚Äù

**IDEA 3**
Cross chain validation applied to a lending protocol. Design a system that uses the OO to allow your assets that are deposited on one chain to be used as collateral on another chain. For example, one deposits 10 ETH on Ethereum and uses that to borrow $1000 on Optimism where the OO verifies and secures the transaction.","",""

Big welcome to everyone at Eth Bogota!  

Our quickstart tutorial aims to give people the opportunity to deploy the oracle within 30 mins and we have a team of smart contract engineers and tech evangelists at the event who are happy to help anyone who encounters any issues when building on UMA. 

If you want to chat through any ideas that you might have for what can be built on UMA head over to our booth and have a chat.  Hart is giving a workshop tonight at 10.30pm in Workshop room 3  on Optimistic truth verification -  worth waiting up for!

Happy hacking!!","",""

üëÄ **ABOUT** 
**UMA** is an optimistic oracle (OO) that can verify any statement proposed on the blockchain. Using economic incentives, the OO tells smart contracts ‚Äúthings about the world‚Äù so contracts and markets asking for that data can be settled. 

**Across**, UMA's sister project is a cross-chain bridge that supports cheap, secure, and near-instantaneous transfers between L2s and to L1. Across transfers are secured by UMA‚Äôs optimistic oracle. 

Builders can use OO as a decentralized truth machine that is flexible enough to handle ambiguity and real-world data with human-powered dispute resolution. UMA‚Äôs OO secures and empowers a diverse set of Web3 applications, including cross-chain bridges, insurance protocols, prediction markets and customizable DAO tooling products.

For this reason, I am personally skeptically of trusting API data directly since APIs are controlled by centralized parties (aka the endpoint publishing the API data can report any value they want).

But if your API data is ""verifiable"", this is solved. For example, if your question is ""the price of XYZ is 123"" (and XYZ is publicly knowable), then you can do the following.

1. Have an off-chain bot query your API to get the price of XYZ.
2. Have the off-chain bot ""propose"" the price of XYZ on-chain by making the following statement:

```
bytes ancillaryData = bytes(""Q:The price of XYZ is $123? A:1 for yes. 0 for no."");
// fill in a couple other parameters; see the quick start guide on the docs site
oo.requestPrice(identifier, requestTime, ancillaryData, bondCurrency, reward); // request price
oo.setCustomLiveness(identifier, requestTime, ancillaryData, 30); // set 30 sec challenge period
// now we propose the value of ""1"" proposing that ""Yes! The price of XYZ is $123"". 
oo.proposePriceFor(msg.sender, address(this), priceIdentifier, timestamp, ancillaryData, int256(1e18);
```
3. After the challenge period (which we set to 30 sec‚Äîthis is a parameter you can change depending on your security needs), we can query to see if the proposed answer was undisputed, and therefore accepted as true.

```
oo.settle(address(this), identifier, requestTime, ancillaryData);
oo.getRequest(address(this), identifier, requestTime, ancillaryData).resolvedPrice;
```","dtb_#0",""
"2022-11-05,14:41:46","jdshutt","#0","And just to follow up on that, a typical challenge period is two hours, but there are a couple of approaches to speed up execution.

One is to shorten the challenge period, if you know there is an active disputer network that will spot and challenge any bad proposals immediately. That might be doable for an API value but you have to consider the risks.

Another approach is to have someone post a large bond to ""insure"" the value, which will be slashed if the value turns out to be incorrect, to compensate the affected parties. That would allow you to use the proposed value immediately, while the longer challenge window is available to challenge the value, slash the proposer, and compensate whoever was harmed (probably by taking the slashed bond for the protocol and redistributing in some way).","",""
"2022-11-05,15:11:44","dtb_","#0","gotcha, appreciate the explanation! so, for the sake of the hackathon, the gateway i'm calling *is* centralized. there's more to unpack, but the TLDR is that i'm part of the team at https://tableland.xyz, which is a decentralized relational database network. on-chain SQL writes get materialized by off-chain nodes, and querying the table data happens by way of off-chain SQL at a gateway.

so, i'm trying to hack an easy way to get that off-chain data back on-chain, using a SQL query like the one i noted above. (we actually are exploring this, past the hackathon.) there will one day be more sophisticated ways to do so that are more protocol / decentralized driven, but right now, it's just a single gateway endpoint to our network (controlled by us).","hartlambur#0",""

For the hackathon, I think there are a few approaches to take here, but fundamentally there is a two step process: step 1, the data is proposed, either by a smart contract triggered by a user action (in a dapp, for example), or by an off-chain bot that makes the call to the smart contract; step 2: after the challenge period has passed, the smart contract that wants to use the data calls `getRequest().resolvedPrice`.","dtb_#0",""

Feel free to reach out to the UMA Team at any point with your questions!


üëÄ **ABOUT**
**UMA** is an optimistic oracle (OO) that can verify any statement proposed on the blockchain. Using economic incentives, the OO tells smart contracts ‚Äúthings about the world‚Äù so contracts and markets asking for that data can be settled.¬†

**Across**, UMA's sister project is a cross-chain bridge that supports cheap, secure, and near-instantaneous transfers between L2s and to L1. Across transfers are secured by UMA‚Äôs optimistic oracle.¬†

Builders can use OO as a decentralized truth machine that is flexible enough to handle ambiguity and real-world data with human-powered dispute resolution. UMA‚Äôs OO secures and empowers a diverse set of Web3 applications, including cross-chain bridges, insurance protocols, prediction markets and customizable DAO tooling products.


üèÜ **PRIZE OVERVIEW**

UMA's OO expands what can be built in Web3 and there are many use cases that haven't been thought of yet. We're looking for submissions that build new and innovative on-chain protocols that require off-chain, cross-chain, or aggregated data verified by our oracle.By hacking on Across you will help to strengthen and broaden the bridging ecosystem and increase adoption of L2s. To do this, we need projects that improve scalability, security, and simplicity ‚Äî and help to provide solid bridging infrastructure that people use without hesitation.

ü•á- $5,000
ü•à - $2,000
üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è - $3,000 pool prize
