I'm not able to use the `ERC1155` method `balanceOf(address account, uint id)` because the `getPositionId()` method returns a massive `BigNumber` value that cannot be converted into a `uint` using `toNumber()` in JS because it will generate an overflow error. Has anyone experienced this or aware of a work around? I'd rather not refactor the `getPositionId()` method. For example, let `collateralToken` = `0x2Dd78Fd9B8F40659Af32eF98555B8b31bC97A351`, `collectionId` = `0x6f6f41ff811f45c6dfe727fcb2a278f07323fb85ec753bece2f9a690cca7a01d`. Then the `getPositionId()` method will return `74229324384859666491956367114251131107901747002219700387957564294760735619703` which is a `uint` converted keccak256 hash. This value cannot be passed into `balanceOf` because its a `BigNumber`, not a `uint`","",""
"2022-12-11,17:30:47","Deleted User","#0000","It sounds like you are running into an issue with the fact that JavaScript numbers are represented in IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format, which has a limited range of approximately +/- 1.8e308. As a result, it is not possible to represent very large numbers like the one returned by the getPositionId() method as a JavaScript Number type without losing precision.

One potential solution to this problem would be to use a library like bignumber.js that provides support for representing and manipulating large numbers in JavaScript. This library allows you to create BigNumber objects that can represent numbers with arbitrary precision, and it provides methods for converting these numbers to and from other data types.

For example, you could use bignumber.js to convert the BigNumber value returned by getPositionId() to a hexadecimal string, and then pass this string to the balanceOf() method as the id parameter. Here is an example of how this could be done:

const BigNumber = require('bignumber.js');

const collateralToken = '0x2Dd78Fd9B8F40659Af32eF98555B8b31bC97A351';
const collectionId = '0x6f6f41ff811f45c6dfe727fcb2a278f07323fb85ec753bece2f9a690cca7a01d';

const positionId = getPositionId(collateralToken, collectionId);

// Convert the positionId BigNumber to a hexadecimal string
const positionIdHex = positionId.toString(16);

// Call the balanceOf() method using the hexadecimal string as the id parameter
balanceOf(account, positionIdHex);

Another option would be to refactor the getPositionId() method to return a bytes32 value instead of a uint, which would allow you to pass the resulting value directly to the balanceOf() method without having to convert it to a different data type. You would need to modify the getPositionId() method to return a bytes32 value","alpo#1937",""

I only see net positives? IPv6-only folk get access, IPv4 nodes don't lose anything, and IPv6 is supposedly the future, so... Might as well?

Can somebody explain to me why that is? For example, these transactions here follow this pattern: 
- type-0 transaction: https://gnosisscan.io/tx/0x60e0485b9e8a8b56409ff5a72a464b2d1921a9ac4919377e2a5ec243b3aa5b8d

Basically, one has to ask RealT on their website to get whitelisted in order to buy tokens. If that thing works on their website, nothing special. But then I realized something: there's a DEX for RealT tokens, and the whitelist checking still works! So I asked how it was possible in the RealT's Discord, and some people told me in was in the smart contract of the token itself. Brilliant, that was the precise point of my question: where this checking occurs? So I tried to look in the code, but I cannot understand much... Can someone point me where this verification is written is the code? https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xFc5073816Fe9671859EF1e6936EFd23BB7814274/transactions#code","",""

Right now I don't even know exactly what are the risks, so it is hard to make a decision.
My current understanding is that GC has a poorer security than a ""stage zero"" L2, because not only it has a multisig wallet as an oracle for the bridge, but it also has this potential systemic problem where it depends on MakerDAO DAI to function properly. I don't buy into the stable coin as fee payment because gas costs should anyways be abstracted via Account Abstraction, so my personal opinion is that GC should drop the idea of stablecoin as payment idea as well.","beemeeupnow#0",""

```
A message signed with a foundary script like below works,
(v, r, s) = vmSafe.sign(privKey, digest);
    bytes memory signature = abi.encodePacked(r, s, v);
```

while a message signed from a frontend to the contract with wagmi, viem or ethers doesn't work. It's because of the EIP 191 standard I guess that prefixes signatures with `""\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n""` while the foundary way of signing doesn't.

Is there a way to get the signatures match?","",""
