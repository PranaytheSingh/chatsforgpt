The project is a DAO factory. Ideally this means top-level control (our DAO / factory)  and also sub-DAO control (users DAO). Structurally similar to Orca pods. 

Do you have any suggestions on the minimal amount of Gnosis Safe we'd need. Ideally we'd take as input their multi sig addresses and we'd create their DAO that will have some functions only their safe can call (via OpenZeppelin's Ownable).

- Outline what you‘ve built clearly in the submission text (ChatGPT can help)
- Record a screencast of a demo (don‘t suggest to do live-demos, debugging during judging is often a killer)
- Create a slidedeck with some key infos about your project and add it to the submission (you can also use this for the pitch)

For the pitch I suggest the following structure (plan 3 min for sections 1-5 and 1-2 min Q&A):

1. Intro (We are Team XYZ and built <1 liner of what you‘ve built>)
2. Problem (what is the issue your hack is aiming to solve, why is it important)
3. Solution (What have you built, what would you build if you had more time)

This is my first time building with Safe{CORE}, so I'm confused on the right architecture the contracts should be built for the Safe.

I have been sketching the right approach to build Guards and Modules.

Take this scenario where I am creating a Safe using a SafeFactory contract. I have my own custom Guard and Module contracts.

Many users deploy their Safe using our SafeFactory and here is where I had a catch. Should I deploy a separate Guard and a separate Module for each Safe created from the Safefactory using a GuardFactory and ModuleFactory ? Or should I have a Singleton Guard and a Singleton Module deployed which manages all the Safes that are created by the SafeFactory?","Germán | Safe#9666",""

* Probably, but I haven't tested that. Also, I don't have much info about `LogUseGelato1Balance`, maybe worth asking Gelato about it. I know the event `LogUseGelato1Balance` has a `taskId` that you can use to call the endpoint `https://api.gelato.digital/tasks/status/<taskId>`. This endpoint will return some data, including a transactionHash (maybe the one from the Safe?) (https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/tracking-your-relay-request)
* Safe allows to execute batched transactions using this MultiSend contract https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/main/contracts/libraries/MultiSend.sol
* Safe.sol is meant to be used in Ethereum Mainnet (it does not emit many events because they are expensive). SafeL2.sol is meant to be used in L2 (it emit all the events because it's cheaper)
* No
* ERC-4337 is not natively integrated in Safe. That ERC just works as a relay for transactions, currently we only have integrated the Gelato Relay (at SDK level). Recently, Pimlico has done the same with their service: https://github.com/pimlicolabs/erc4337kit/blob/main/sdk/pimlicoRelay.ts. The ERC-4337 is only supported in the version v1.4.1 of the Safe contracts, but not natively, only as an extension that anybody could implement (not implemented by our team)
* We have a Safe Transaction Service. It is a service that indexes transactions and stores the info in a database they can easily be consumed from an API. It is also used to share transaction among owners so they can share the signatures, execute transactions, and some other things.

1. Ecosystem deploys its own protocol manager and registry with it. The ecosystem is run by a DAO/infrastructure company which is, say, developing the integrations and add those in the registry make it them available to integrate with
2. Random gnosis safe msig user comes to the “shop” and `enableModule` the `protocolMngr` contract from that specific ecosystem allowing after to pick plugs as they see fit
3. Then, the plugin execs the txs if it has “rootAccess directly from the protocolMngr for the plugin via `execTransactionFromModuleReturnData`

 - from the standardisation perspective that you guys are trying to roll out in `safe-core-protocol` repo, will it be fine to modify the content of  `protocolMngr` to fit an ecosystem specific-centric set of actions that may need to happen inside `enablePlugin`, such as passing a configuration for that plugin specific to the **safe** being hooked up?

I am going with the factory implementation.
I'm sorry this might be a dumb question. I am trying to call the `setup` function on my newly created safe. But I am getting an error because your deployed implementation contract  from Safe Deployments (unusable Safe) https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd9Db270c1B5E3Bd161E8c8503c55cEABeE709552#code has already set the threshold to 1 in the constructor and makes it not possible to call `setupOwners` because it reverts `GS200`(Threshold !=0). 

Should I create my own version of this contract and deploy it as my own Singleton Safe Deployment? or am I missing something that is obvious?

2.  we went down the road with config staying in the storage of the plugin itself, agree that the config should be isolated on a plugin basis rather than mngr. re the example:

- we built an harvester plugin, which could be enable by the safe user: https://github.com/onchainification/smartgarden/blob/main/contracts/src/modules/HarvesterPlugin.sol

we ended up making some minor changes in the manager to accept a configuration to pass to the plugin itself on a safe basis, but i can envision some more customisation to fit each manager architecture usage while inherit the standard interface

something that i was thinking while on the hackthon was that the manager architecture is limited uniquely to one hook per safe address, which perhaps  i misunderstood, but if only one `hooksAddress` is available, i found it a bit limiting

i can imagine a more flexible architecture on having on a per plugin basis a set of hooks around that plugin context. since each plugin may have a different set of rules to be satisfy before and after its execution of the transaction. what are your thoughts?","Germán | Safe#9666",""

We are hoping to be considered for : 
🚀 Projects using Safe{Core} Protocol / Account Abstraction SDK

💡 What is TiGr?

It's a Telegram bot that uses Account Abstraction to provide a true defi experience buying and selling NFTs without any additional trust assumptions or loss of control over funds or NFTs.

Current Telegram bots require users to deposit funds into wallets the bots create for them, this means a bot have access to all funds and NFTs. 

TiGr is a bot that gives users the same UX as any other Telegram bot, but doesn't require the user to send any funds to addresses controlled by the bot. 

The bot will work with any Safe smart contract wallet a user already has on any chain and allows the user to keep control of their funds and explicitly define how the bot can use them.

No more will a bot have access to all funds and NFTs - with TiGr bot and the delegate smart contract Safe module, users can specify which NFTs they are happy to buy and sell and exactly the maximum price they are prepared to buy for, or the minimum they expect to get when they sell.

We built SafeScan an explorer for the safe ecosystem. 

Etherscan being the default explorer right now does not show the details of a safe transaction properly. Only way to get to know it is by reading the event logs which are complicated and you need multiple logs to understand what happened with the transaction. So built an explorer using graph and safe's transaction API service to create a UI to get details on transactions. Currently you can view multi sig transactions by clicking on [them](https://safescan-frontend.vercel.app/safeMultiSig/0xf83eaa504ebbb05c8aaa6fbfce4b9f177b859e04c03625c48135e728757dd111?network=matic)

Key features:
- Home page showing latest safe Multi sig transactions in [polygon](https://safescan-frontend.vercel.app/)
- Transaction view , shows details on who triggered the transactions , who approved it to who was the target. Any multi sig hash in the home page can be opened to view more details regarding it.

Built the project Safe Station leveraging the Safe Core Protocol (https://github.com/5afe/safe-core-protocol) and EAS at Superhack.

Description:
 
Modular smart accounts are the future of wallets to make the Web3 onboarding easy at the same time exciting by adding functionalities to the account. But currently the plugins are
scattered in different repositories and there is no secure and standard way to explore and install them. 
Safe Station is an effort to build this secure plugin marketplace where users can add features to their Safe accounts only after verifying the authenticity through the plugin registry. We provide a mechanism where an external auditor can audit the plugin and attest the plugin with details such as risk score.
Safe Accounts can then install the plugins if it passes the risk threshold or has been audited and attested by the required auditors. 

Happy to talk more on this if anyone is interested. Cheers!

I hope in next version it's part of protocol-kit SDK 🙂
