Feel free to reach out to the Lit Protocol Team at any point with your questions! 

Just giving you all a quick snapshot for you to get quickly acquainted!


üëÄ **ABOUT** 
**Lit** is a decentralized compute, encryption, and access control network powered by threshold cryptography.

With Lit, developers can automate signing, reading, and writing data to web3 decentralized networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Additionally, data can be private in these open web applications and only decrypted by authorized parties with Lit access control. 

Lit offers two products, Prograblem Key Pairs (PKPs) and Decentralized Access Control. There is one bounty for each product!

Best use of Lit Actions and Programmable Key Pairs
$3K USDC

Improving the user experience in web3 is essential for the long-term success and adoption of decentralized technology. By making it easier and more intuitive for users to engage with the ecosystem, we can help create a more open, transparent, and user-centric internet for everyone.

Use Lit to create a seamless onboarding process or abstract away signing through programmatic signing. Lit provides the underlying infrastructure for developers to set up programmable signing based on on-chain and off-chain information.

Criteria for the prize: 
Must utilize Lit Actions and Programmable Key Pairs.
UI/UX is top priority!
Output should include a demo and documentation of how it utilizes Lit.

‚ñ†TL;DR For Lit Protocol
„ÉªWe use Access Control in Lit Protocolto encrypt the EOA and its associated Zk Proof, signature, etc
„ÉªZK Identity, Sismo alone could not accomplish the switching of user profiles to Private, so Access Contorl was a must for our product.
„ÉªAs you know With ZKP alone, proof of address ownership could be achieved, but EOA could not be passed, so encryption was required","rwiggum#0",""
