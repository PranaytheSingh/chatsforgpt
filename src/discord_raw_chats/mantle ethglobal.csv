🔥 ** What we’ve built ?** A dApp that uses Chainlink oracle to provide escrow service to financial institutions, to increase the amount of credit they can lend in** fiat local currency **to unbanked people from LatAm, without taking extra risk. The person without credit scoring sets up a warranty in **stablecoin** and the institution grants them a credit card /credit for the same amount or more, according to their business rules. 

🌐  **Where? **We’ve developed this project on EVM-compatible blockchains and love to developed on **Mantle. Would love some feedback 🙂 **

🕯️ **Why?** This helps the **65% unbanked population of LatAm ** and contributes the overall economic growth of the region. After this first step, people demonstrate the ability to pay in local currency their debts and **start building their credit scoring** that will allow them to access better options in the future. 

🚀 **What’s next?** We are working in the unification of different wallets using zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable credentials to create a n**ew decentralized digital identity**, cross-lender, cross-blockchain, and cross-scoring protocols unifying them. 

Check it out:  https://ethglobal.com/showcase/xscrow-j571i
