üëÄ **ABOUT**
**MetaMask** is the leading self-custodial wallet. The safe and simple way to access blockchain applications and web3. Trusted by millions of users worldwide.

**Linea** is a type 2 zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). A zkEVM replicates the Ethereum environment as a rollup and allows developers to build on it as they would on Ethereum mainnet. Linea allows you to deploy any smart contract, use any tool, and develop as if you're building on Ethereum. For users, this enables the experience and security guarantees of Ethereum, but with lower transaction costs.


üèÜ **PRIZE OVERVIEW**

**1. Build a dapp on Linea**
*We have $5000 max for up to 5 winners*

**2. Unity & MetaMask ‚ù§Ô∏è Builders**
*We have $1000 for one winner.*

We're introducing a work-in-progress ‚ú®**Snaps Simulator**‚ú®

Our main goal is to reduce the friction for devs trying to build snaps, so we've decoupled snaps execution from MetaMask and run the production snaps environment directly in the browser.

This means:
‚Äî **Hot-reloading snaps with no install screens**
‚Äî Easy-access to sending requests to all types of snaps handlers (no building a dapp required)
‚Äî Simulation of the MetaMask background and connection to the underlying node
‚Äî Simulation of Snaps Custom UI dialogs and transaction insights directly in the browser

We hope this will help anyone building a snap during the hackathon ‚Äî any feedback is much appreciated!
