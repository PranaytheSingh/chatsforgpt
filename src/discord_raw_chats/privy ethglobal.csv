Unfortunately, <@763089114060292096>vy-io/react-auth isn‚Äôt compatible with React Native yet, which is the issue you‚Äôre encountering - it‚Äôs only built for the web. We do have a React Native SDK in the pipeline but it unfortunately won‚Äôt be ready ahead of the hackathon this weekend üòû


If you‚Äôre looking to build for mobile, consider building a PWA instead? It may actually be easier to prototype with for hackathon purposes. We just released a blog post and starter repo to help folks get started!
