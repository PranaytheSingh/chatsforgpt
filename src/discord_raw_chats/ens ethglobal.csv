**Support Help**: If you have a question about ENS, please ask it in our normal Discord channel: https://discord.gg/AskZbFx

If you integrate ENS and submit for the ENS prize, **please explain on your project description page how you integrated ENS (could even be one sentence)**. If I have to go searching through your dapp for how you integrated ENS, you're unlikely to win our prize.

Two easy ways to integrate ENS:
- **Reverse Resolution**: If you display a 0x address anywhere (e.g. after the user connects their wallet), do a reverse look-up and display the user's ENS name in their reverse record instead: https://docs.ens.domains/dapp-developer-guide/resolving-names#reverse-resolution

- **Forward Resolution**: In any field in which a person might enter a cryptocurrency address, enable the user to also enter an ENS name: https://docs.ens.domains/dapp-developer-guide/resolving-names#looking-up-ethereum-addresses

- Lots of other things you could do with ENS so feel free to experiment or do more, but these two are easy and apply to most dapps","",""

I also found this one 0x57f1887a8BF19b14fC0dF6Fd9B2acc9Af147eA85 . For instance to register a domain I have to interact with the BaseRegistrar, right? Going to the latter address 0x57f18...2e1e I find the following to functions
```
function register(uint256 id, address owner, uint duration) external returns(uint) {
      return _register(id, owner, duration, true);
    }
function registerOnly(uint256 id, address owner, uint duration) external returns(uint) {
      return _register(id, owner, duration, false);
    }
```
Ah I see, the first address is the registrar and the second one is the token address?

So for instance if I want to create a new ens domain I would have to call 
```
function register(uint256 id, address owner, uint duration) virtual external returns(uint);
```
with id being the keccak256 of the name, right? and suppose I would like to set a record of an existing ens domain, I would have to call this function?
```
function setRecord(bytes32 node, address owner, address resolver, uint64 ttl) external;
```
but whould I have to turn the domain name into bytes32 first? And the owner address is clear to me, that's mostly msg.sender, but the resolver address?","",""

Name: supersaiyan
Description: 
Supersaiyan is a decentralised platform that allows anyone to create a subscription service on ethereum in a just few clicks. 

We used ENS to automatically issue sub domains to subscription service providers. We did this by performing a DNSSEC ENS integration on supersaiyan.xyz. This was really cool as it meant that service providers could use their issued payment links http://trozler.supersaiyan.xyz/, as ENS names as well.

The use case was inspired by the argent wallet DNSSEC integration.

1. So ens is just a url shortener, but for wallet addresses?

2. Someone-what unrelated to the technical application but do you guys have an authorized secondary market for ENS buying/selling?

3. Can I put a ENS to a contract? Like mint.nftproject.com
    .eth sorry

3. not sure about this (wait for the team member) but i would say it is a yes but only smart contract with support for it

"2022-01-15,17:12:30","kingsarenothing","#6864","Hi ENS!

A couple of quick questions about avatars:
1. I see in the docs that 'avatar' can be a URL to an image. Are there any other restrictions on the file format?
2. Is the avatar cached or can it be dynamic (i.e. return a different image on each call)?

Thanks!","",""
"2022-01-15,17:31:31",".0xprof","#0","till we wait for the ens team
- the images are usually set (if you are the owner of a name) you can use an nft as your avatar ( i dont know if they allow to use regular pics)
- and i dont think it is dynamic because it is something being set by the owner of the name but that is something we will love to see","kingsarenothing#6864",""
"2022-01-15,18:25:15","Ginge","#3511","2. The actual metadata that gets returned from the tokenURI function of your NFT contract won't change (unless it's actually updated on-chain, if the contract allows that). But inside that metadata the `image` could potentially point to a web2 server hosting the image, and the centralized provider of that server could change the image that gets served up. Sort of defeats the point of decentralization obviously, but there are still NFTs out there that function this way.

If the metadata points to an IPFS content hash then that won't change. But there are other non-standard metadata formats out there too like Async Art's which seek to do exactly that - dynamic images. Like someone showed me this NFT of the moon that changes dynamically depending on the time of day. https://async.art/art/master/0xb6dae651468e9593e4581705a09c10a76ac1e0c8-3447

You can view the metadata for that here ipfs://Qmcvm5ddzgwQvdubTNoKRwJpUitLFT5Wo2PvWetsmZUB5M . You'll see that the `image` just points to the default new moon state, but the actual dynamic pieces are in a custom `layout` field that isn't supported by the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards. So on most sites the avatar would just show up as just a black circle. But theoretically a client dapp could support ENS primary names with dynamic avatars like that if they wanted. Same as how a client could support rendering MP4 file avatars if they wanted to (I think Rarible does this with some of their own custom contracts).

In most cases, a client website/dapp, like OpenSea, is going to request the avatar from the ENS metadata service and then cache it on their own storage. That's why they also have a Refresh Metadata option. It's a tradeoff they make for efficiency I suppose.",".0xprof#0",""

"2022-01-15,18:30:01","Ginge","#3511","1. There are no restrictions on file format per se, but practically with the integrations that are currently out there, it's best to stuck to image formats that can be rendered inside of an `img` tag in your browser, since that's what usually happens. So for example an MPEG video won't render most places, but GIFs and SVGs (which can do animations) will work.","kingsarenothing#6864",""

Here is my problem:
1) I have  cyphertest.eth
2) I built a ""shop"" contract accpeting eth and minting subnames
3) the contract isn't minting since it isn't the owner of the name.eth (right?)
4) yesterday I was on ENS discord where raffy sugggested to use setSubnodeOwner function to give permission to my shop_contract to mint subnames

I had a look at the code but I don't understand
And very likely the inputs I set are wrong since metamask gives error

when I call with the wallet owner of pumptv.eth and create a subname this is what happens:
https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xef4f74d4694c7262bdecfef0e5658ea94b77e57154204d74bc2e4ee0da811a37
and it is ok the wrapper creates a subname

now I try to setSubNodeOwner and I am asked these inputs:
https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x114d4603199df73e7d157787f8778e21fcd13066#writeContract#F17

I really don't know how to interpretate those inputs and the code
According to what raffy told me I was expecting to just have to set the shop_contract address in order to give it the permission to mint subnames
he also told me I can use this function to turn off/on the minting permission of the shop_contract
can anyone explain me please what inputs I should insert?
it i asking the parent, the label  etc. etc. 
I am confused
any help? thanks in advance","",""

so in wagmi for example:
```jsx
const ensName = useEnsName({
  address: '0xA0Cf798816D4b9b9866b5330EEa46a18382f251e',

this means you'll also have to add `mainnet` in wagmi's `configureChains` https://wagmi.sh/core/providers/configuring-chains","_venmus_#0",""

I'm not sure if scaffold-eth does both of those things or just resolves ENS names, so hard to say
