Feel free to reach out to the Flashbots Team at any point with your questions!

üëÄ **ABOUT**
Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to stateful blockchains. Our primary focus is to enable a *permissionless*, *transparent*, and *sustainable* ecosystem for MEV, via a three-pronged approach:

- **Illuminate:** bringing transparency to MEV activity.
- **Democratize:** democratizing access to MEV revenue.
- **Distribute:** enabling sustainable distribution of MEV revenue.

We have brought transparency through open MEV activity analytics and dashboard and public and open , with the community, for the ecosystem. We have democratized access to MEV revenue with MEV-Boost that gives all validators access to MEV revenue on equal footing, with the support of a vibrant ecosystem of builders and searchers.

We have started distributing MEV revenue using the MEV-share protocol. This protocol returns 90% of captured MEV to users, wallets, and dapps, who can enjoy its benefits simply by sending transactions with programmable privacy to Flashbots Protect. MEV-share also poses a new challenge for searchers, as they must now learn how to compete for and execute against users' private transactions.


üèÜ **PRIZE OVERVIEW**

üí∞ $2500 - most useful onboarding site for Flashbots Protect with MEV-Share
 üí∏ $1500 -  building the coolest bot searching on MEV-Share
üèÜ $1000 - best design for using MEV-Share and programmable privacy in another application

"2023-07-22,10:46:18",".cryptowanderer","#0","yeah, exactly - it sees hard to figure out which one it actually came from just by calling the api. It also seems hard to get the information for a single user account so I can display it when/if they choose to connect a wallet to see what the effect of using the RPC has been. Is there any more detail than this available?
