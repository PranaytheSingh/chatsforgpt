We are hacking along on a unique follower module and have been working on the ui asynchronously on top of lenster (very cool btw). Naturally to side step the whitelisting of the custom follower module we are working locally. 

The ui is 'ready' üòÖ  and I would like to start doing the wiring to the contracts however need to reconfigure lenster to the local network. Lenster is quite heavily reliant on the api and I cant seem to find the api repo to run a local api. Is this something I can possibly do or get access to or should I shift gears and develop directly to the contracts via an embeded pvt key in the ui ?<a:blobsweat:963483356962648105>","",""

- They‚Äôre not suited for web3 candidates
- It‚Äôs hard for candidates to prove skill
- It‚Äôs difficult for recruiters to verify talent. 

BlockFuse revolutionizes the recruitment process in web3 by providing the infrastructure for educators, recruiters, and candidates to mint and aggregate proof-of-skill badges with the rest of your professional identity.

We‚Äôre looking for hiring managers, recruiters, job seekers or anyone who is currently working in web3 to complete a short, 5 minute survey to help us refine our solution. https://forms.gle/NBWzVqRbJoTEtsrL6

"2023-04-16,01:08:17","darrylyeo","#0","Hey Lens frens! Missed the in-person presentation so posting here.

For ETHTokyo I built a Lens interface with profile lookups and authentication, with support for all three deployed instances of the protocol (Polygon PoS, Polygon Mumbai, and Sandbox Polygon Mumbai).

I also added first-class support for Lens handles across all address inputs in the interface - you can type any Lens handle (e.g. stani.lens) and it will automatically resolve to the owner's address if it makes sense for the given context.

I just scratched the surface of the Lens API this weekend and hope to dive even deeper for future events!

**Lens Protocol**¬†is the social layer for web3.

The Lens social graph enables creators to take ownership of their content wherever they go across the dozens of high quality apps across the Ecosystem, with new ones coming online every month.

With Lens, you can easily build social applications or integrate social features into your existing applications. For developers, one of Lens' most powerful features is that it eliminates the need to build, maintain and pay for back-end infrastructure, allowing developers to focus 100% on building the consumer experience.

Teams with as few as 1 developer are able to build polished experiences on Lens using the variety of APIs and SDKs available to builders.
